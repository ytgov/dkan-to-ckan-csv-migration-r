42100,"information","Early Jurassic porphyry(?) copper (-gold) deposits at Minto and Williams Creek, Carmacks Copper Belt, western Yukon","The Minto and Williams Creek copper (-gold) deposits in western Yukon are hosted by variably deformed Early Jurassic (198-197 Ma; U-Pb) plutonic rocks and to a lesser extent strongly metamorphosed supracrustal rocks. These rocks are pendants and schlieren within slightly younger (197 Ma; U-Pb), intermediate-composition intrusive phases of the Granite Batholith. Chalcopyrite and bornite are disseminated and also occur as stringers in these rocks. Alteration muscovite associated with late quartz-feldspar-epidote veins gives a 182 Ma Ar-Ar age. Geobarometry on postmineral intrusive phases in the area indicate that they were emplaced at a depth of >9 km. Hornblende geochemical studies of plutonic and meta-plutonic host rocks at Minto and Williams Creek indicate that they formed in a continental magmatic arc setting. Cu/Au ratios and field observations indicate that supergene mobility of copper was more extensive at Williams Creek than at Minto. Our results indicate that the two deposits represent variations on typical copper (-gold) porphyry deposits.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Mineral Deposit","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:25","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42600,"information","High Level Terraces Along Parts of Yukon River and Sixtymile River (115 N/9 East Half, 115 O/5, and 115 O/12), Yukon","High level terraces representing former valley bottom deposits exist along Yukon River and several of its tributaries. The terraces contain fluvial gravel deposits wich are veneered by loess. Soil development in the gravel suggest they predate the oldest Pleistocene glaciation in central Yukon..

These high terraces are given a Neogene age (Miocene-Pliocene) based on their relative heights and the ages of bedrock that they occur on. They may be the same age as White Channel gravel in Klondike area.

Along Yukon River their elevation varies from 43 to 88 m (140 ft to 290 ft) above present river level rising to the north. Flow directions based on imbrication measurements in pits indicate flow generally followed that of the modern Yukon River. The paleo-Yukon River flowed to the nroth when these gravels were laid down.

The reason why terrace elevations rise in elevation northward, opposite to the present drainage is presumed to be from tectonic warping. The area around Dawson was uplifted more than that near the mouth of Stewart River.

Placer gold was recovered in small quantities from test pits at several sites along the Yukon River and Sixtymile River valley. The gold is typically flat, fine grained and far-traveled; suggestive of deposition in a bar environment. The number of gold particles in gravel samples (each sample 23 litre volume) ranged from 0 to 1 in Sixtymile River valley and 0 to 12 in Yukon River valley terraces.  Downcutting of Yukon River and its tributaries led to placer accumulations in the modern creeks. Highly anomalous arsenic in sediment soils from Ten Mile Creek drainage with coincident anomalous gold suggest gold-arsenopyrite veins as sources for placer gold in that creek.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:34","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42700,"information","Soil Geochemistry above Deeply Weathered Porphyry Deposits in Unglaciated Terrain, Dawson Range, Central Yukon","Much of west-central Yukon escaped glaciation and is underlain by leached and oxidized, deeply weathered bedrock. Background and anomalous metal values in these soils are presumed to be lower than normal and therefore increase the challenge of interpreting soil geochemical surveys. It is suspected that the geochemical contrast between background and anomalous values can be maximized by sampling a particular soil horizon or analysing a specific size fraction.

One hundred and sixteen samples were collected from soil profiles at ten sites above four porphyry-style mineral deposits - Antoniuk, Revenue, Nucleus and Casino in the Dawson Range of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane. B-horizon soils are locally clay-rich, thin and poorly developed. C-horizon soils are unconsolidated and very coarse grained. Bedrock samples from each site were crushed and analysed for comparison. All samples were analysed using the Au plus 32 (FA-AA and ICP) package which is a popular and economical method currently employed in most exploration programs.

The results are generally consistent within the few samples taken at each deposit, but vary considerably overall, and probably reflect the variable physio-chemical conditions between the deposits. Gold and copper are emphasized in the evaluation of the data, but gold data from the fine-grained fraction are incomplete due to insufficient material from the generally coarse-grained soils. Although statistical accuracy cannot be confirmed with such a small sample set, the following trends are recognized:

- the highest gold values typically occur in the lowest soil horizon (C2) and in the -200 mesh fraction;
- the highest copper values were found in both the -35+80 and -200 mesh fractions (deposit dependent) but were consistently richer in the C2 horizon;
- metal values are commonly depleted in the highest B-horizon (B1), particularly in the +35-80 fraction;
- metal values are most commonly enriched in the B2 and C2 horizons;
- metal depletion is most pronounced in the -35+80 fraction;
- there is a strong positive correlation between gold, copper and molybdenum;
- in addition, As, Bi, P, and to a lesser extent, Sb and Sr have a strong positive correlation with gold, As, Sb, Sr and to a lesser extent Ba and Pb have a strong positive correlation with copper.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Detailed studies of ultramafic rocks in CCT, SMT, Livengood Terrane and the Kluane metamorphic assemblage across Yukon, Alaska and British Columbia were conducted at nine site locations. The most common type of ultramafic rock present at these localities is serpentinized harzburgite. The ultramafic rocks from the CCT and SMT have been interpreted as the lower layers from dismembered ophiolite complexes. Samples collected from the CCT are consistently harzburgite, whereas samples from the SMT are both mantle-derived harzburgite and lherzolite.

This led to the discovery of additional VMS mineralization that includes GP4F, Ice and significant new reserves at Fyre Lake. Numerous VMS prospects were identified.

The Fyre Lake, KZK, GP4F, Wolverine, and Ice VMS deposits are hosted by the Yukon-Tanana Terrane (YTT) in the Finlayson Lake district of southeastern Yukon. The Fyre Lake deposit (8 200 000 tonnes of 2.1% Cu and 0.73 g/t Au) is stratigraphically lowest and occurs in mafic metavolcanic rocks of the Devonian to Mississippian Grass Lakes succession. The KZK and GP4F deposits (13 000 000 tonnes of 5.5% Zn, 1% Cu, 1.3% Pb, 125 g/t Ag and 1.2 g/t Au and 1 500 000 tonnes of 6.4% Zn, 3.1% Pb, 0.1% Cu, 89.7 g/t Ag and 2.0 g/t Au, respectively) are within the Devonian to Mississippian succession but lie stratigraphically above Fyre Lake in felsic metavolcanic
rocks. The Wolverine deposit (6 237 000 tonnes of 12.66% Zn, 1.33% Cu, 1.55% Pb, 370.9 g/t Ag and 1.76 g/t Au) is hosted by Carboniferous rhyolitic metavolcanic rocks and carbonaceous argillite of the Wolverine succession. The Ice deposit (4 561 863 tonnes of 1.48% Cu ) occurs highest in the stratigraphy and is hosted within late Palaeozoic mafic metavolcanic and associated metasedimentary rocks of the Campbell Range succession.

The YTT underlies a large part of Yukon, east-central Alaska and parts of British Columbia. VMS mineralization occurs within rocks of the YTT in the Dawson and Glenlyon areas of Yukon, in the Teslin-Rancheria area in Yukon and adjacent British Columbia, and in several areas within Alaska, as well as in the Finlayson Lake area of the Yukon. In the Dawson area, which lays adjacent to the massive-sulphide-rich Finlayson Lake district (before approximately 425 km of right lateral movement on the Tintina Fault), VMS prospects are hosted in Late Devonian to mid-Mississippian Nasina Assemblage and Permian Klondike Schist. In the Glenlyon area, massive sulphide mineralization and chert horizons occur within a belt of rocks that is at least 20 km long. In the Teslin-Rancheria area and adjacent northern British Columbia, several VMS prospects have been identified.

The Alaskan VMS occurrences are in the Delta, Bonnifield and Trident Glacier districts. Exploration during this period was not confined to the YTT but extended into rocks of the North American miogeocline that are coeval, and possibly correlative, with Devono-Mississippian strata of the YTT. This led to the discovery of additional resources at the Marg and Wolf VMS deposits. The Marg deposit (5 527 002 tonnes of 1.76% Cu, 2.46% Pb, 4.60% Zn, 62.7 g/t Ag and 1.0 g/t Au) occurs in the Selwyn Basin within a Devonian to Mississippian sequence of carbonaceous siliceous phyllite, quartz-muscovite and quartz-chlorite phyllite and massive quartzite. These strata also host the Jane prospect. The Wolf deposit (4.1 million tonnes of 6.2% Zn, 1.8% Pb and 84 g/t Ag) occurs in the Pelly-Cassiar Platform within the Devono-Mississippian Pelly Mountains volcanic belt and is hosted by felsic metavolcanic and associated metasedimentary rocks. Numerous other VMS prospects, including MM, occur throughout the length of this 80-km-long volcanic belt.

The newly defined VMS deposits are comparable in size to the average Canadian VMS deposit indicating the
discoveries are significant. Mineralization in the YTT occurs in Late Devonian to Permian strata thus there are
several prospective horizons and the potential for additional discoveries is significant.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:23","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42001,"information","Use of Diffuser Systems for Dispersion of Placer Mining Effluent","Placer mining involves washing stream gravel to separate and save free gold particles. Usually a placer mine must discharge excess effluent water, which contains some residual suspended fine silt and clay particles, from a settling pond, back into the stream. This study examines the applicability of introducing placer effluent through a diffuser to lessen environmental impact.

A diffuser is a mechanism which introduces effluent fluid into the main current of a receiving stream so that mixing and dispersion are facilitated. A diffuser usually consists of a header pipe with one or more discharge ports. Effluent is ejected from the ports at high velocity into the receiving water. Performance of the diffuser depends on the diameter, spacing, and angle of the ports in relation to the water column.

Diffusers are used effectively in many industrial applications. Computer programs have been developed which predict the effluent plume from a diffuser, using input data from both the receiving stream and the effluent discharge. We used the CORMIX model, which was developed for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This program can also be used in the design of diffusers.

We modelled two series of scenarios using receiving water data for the Fortymile River. In one series, we varied the concentration of suspended solids in the effluent. In the other series, we varied the flow rate of the effluent. In alll cases from both of these series of models, the CORMIX program predicted that the effluent diffused into the receiving water rapidly. A water quality objective of 12.5 mg of suspended sediment per litre of water was achieved in a very short distance downstream of the diffuser.

We also used the CORMIX model to predict effluent behaviour in some hypothetical receiving streams. These scenarios showed that the larger the receiving stream, the better the diffusion rate. It also showed that diffusers would not be as effective on small streams where large effluent concentrations are discharged. Dilution is limited by the flow rate of the receiving water.

The CORMIX model cannot predict whether sediment from the effluent plume will settle out on the streambed. Our team hydrologist examined the question of potential sedimentation by using the following techniques:: comparing background to introduced sediment levels, calculating the shear/fall velocity ratio for the sediment, comparison to flume testing, and comparison to other field investigations. He predicted that in the example of the Fortymile River using our mine effluent parameters, there would be little or no sediment deposited on the streambed from a diffuser installation.

The use of diffuser systems to disperse placer effluent into receiving water appears to be an effective way of mitigating the impact of placer mining on the aquatic environment, providing there is adequate flow in the receiving stream. Effluent is dispersed into the stream flow, reducing the possibility of sedimentation of the stream substrate.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:23","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42002,"information","Geological, Geochemical and Geophysical Exploration for Diamonds in Yukon","The world production of diamonds in 1990 was more than 100 million carats (metric carats, or CM; 1 carat = 0.2 grams), compared to 75 million in 1985, and 15 million in 1950. This represents a more than 14% per year growth rate. The value of 1990 production was about US$4.5 billion (1992 US$), and diamond is the fourth-ranked commodity in the world in terms of value, after Fe, Au, Cu, and Zn. Primary sources of diamonds are the mantle-derived igneous rocks eclogite and peridotite, brought to the surface by rare ultrabasic magmas, kimberlite and lamproite being the most common. Secondary diamond deposits, such as the marine deposits of southwest Africa, are derived from primary sources by weathering processes that acted for several million years to transport and concentrate diamonds at favourable localities.

Of approximately 5,000 known kimberlites world-wide, fewer than 50 are or have been mined successfully. There have been fewer than 15 major producers (more than 3 million carats/year), with only 6 major discoveries made in the last 50 years. The Point Lake pipe, the first discovered in the Lac De Gras kimberlite field in Canada's Northwest Territories, is potentially another major poducing pipe. The Point Lake discovery is a clear success story in diamond exploration, and as such, it is given a brief review here. As the surrounding kimberlite field is still undergoing exploration, the information available is incomplete, and estimates of the importance of diamond deposits are preliminary. However, initial results at the time of writing indicate strong potential for one or several diamond mines to be developed in the Northwest Territories.

Why explore for diamonds in North America?
- North America has the largest craton and stable platform area in the world.
- Relative to Siberia and South Africa, hundreds of kimberlites remain to be discovered.
- North America is underexplored for diamonds.
- Large gem diamonds have been found as alluvials in North America.
- Several areas are known to have favourable mineral chemistry.
- Operating costs of open-pit kimberlite mines are very low.
- Capital costs are similar to other mines; tailings are non-acid generating, and no strong chemicals are used during extraction.

42004,"information","Natural Land Reclamation for Mineral Exploration Properties & Placer Mines in Yukon","The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act legislates that development activities requiring federal permits be assessed through environmental screening, and environmental impacts mitigated with existing technology. The implementation of Mining Land Use Regulations on mineral claims in Yukon will require routine environmental impact assessment within a permitting system. A database of known environmental impacts related to mineral exploration and placer mining will thus make the screening process more efficient. This particular project focuses on three different mining districts of Yukon, and provides information on soil, overburden, vegetation, slope stability, and permafrost conditions on disturbed and undisturbed surfaces related to mineral exploration and placer mining.
Disturbances included in this study consist of trenches (dating from 1912 to 1993), drill pads (dating from 1967 to 1993), ripped and compacted surfaces associated with roads and camps, and placer mine highwalls and tailings piles (dating from 1911 to 1993). Observations include detailed vegetation description(tree, tall shrubs, low shrub, dwarf shrub, herb, graminoid, and mosses and lichens layers), soil texture and basic chemistry, slope, height, width and age of the trenches, elevation, aspect and latitude of the site, and description of any active processes such as slope erosion, permafrost degradation, failure, sheet erosion and gullying.
The preferred sites and rates of natural revegetation by pioneer species were related to disturbance characteristics, such as trench orientation, surface compaction, and presence or absence of permafrost. Recommendations on site abandonment and treatment were formulated using analysis of the above data. Factors most important to the natural revegetation of sites were identified as elevation (alpine versus subalpine), at least 20 centimetres of soil with at least 20% fine-grained matrix, and stable slopes with angles of 45 degrees or less. Trench design, mixture of organic matter with the surface material, aspect and slope position of the disturbance are significant factors, but of lesser importance. Placer mined sites located in fine-grained, organic and ice-rich sites were found to reclaim both cuts and tailings successfully within five to ten years.
The least intrusive approach to site reclamation is to abandon disturbances in a state such that natural colonization could take place within a few years, and the site re-integrated to its ecosystem within a reasonable period of time. However, in some cases, slopes will not reach stable profile without the help of surface vegetation. More aggressive revegetation procedures may then be required (contouring and/or seeding), especially when dealing with high alpine sites. A revegetation strategy should take into consideration the local ecosystem and plant succession. Species imported to the area should facilitate, not eliminate, the re-entry of local pioneer forb, grass and shrubs species. A program designed to test the optimum conditions for site abandonment could provide further information on physical requirement for physical design of abandoned features and possible seed/fertilizer mixtures in alpine and subalpine areas.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:23","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42006,"information","Assessment of Long-Term Vegetation and Site Conditions at Reclaimed Yukon Mineral Exploration Sites","There have recently been many changes in the way mining exploration projects operate, including new technologies, new exploration targets and new environmental regulations. Following recent amendments, to the Yukon Quartz and Placer Mining Acts, a significant new piece of legislation came into effect in December, 1999. The Yukon Quartz Mining Land Use Regulations, administered by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, now requires the reclamation of disturbed land on mining claims. But what happens at these reclaimed sites several years after the work is finished? Is there more than one way to successfully reclaim such land? How do local conditions affect the regrowth of plants on these sites and how much preparation of the reclaimed surface is needed? This report may not provide answers to all these questions, but it presents data collected at several Yukon sites, each with different ages and having had different reclamation treatments. From these observations, patterns on the success or failure of revegetation programs emerge and provide information on the rate and extent of natural revegetation at reclaimed mining trenches.

Several types of reclamation sites were looked at in several different areas of Yukon, both above and below the treeline. Three of these were exploration trenches that were backfilled and revegetated as part of an experimental reclamation program in 1995. These reclaimed exploration sites included the Red Ridge trench, near Annie Lake in the Whitehorse area, the Nucleus trench, west of Carmacks and the Hawk trench near Dawson City. Each of these reclaimed trenches were revegetated with different seed and fertilizer mixes. This report summarizes how these sites looked in 1999, four years after the reclamation work was done.

At Division Mountain, west of Braeburn, several coal trenches and drill pads were reclaimed by a mineral exploration company between 1995 and 1997. These sites were also looked at in 1999 in order to measure the success of the revegetation program. The last place visited in 1999 was Jason Knoll near Macmillan Pass where a number of exploration trenches and drill pads were reclaimed in the early 1980s. This site provides a look at the longer-term success rate of a revegetation program near the treeline.

Refilled and contoured trenches, with rough and loose surfaces seem to revegetate well. The replacement of original soil is most important and makes the most significant contribution to the revegetation process, particularly at high elevation sites or sites in extreme climatic conditions. The replacement of tree debris significantly improves habitat conditions for small mammals by decreasing access and visibility for predators.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:23","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42033,"information","Placer gold deposits of the Mayo area, central Yukon","Placer deposits in the Mayo area occur in a wide variety of geomorphic settings, including alluvial fans, gulch gravel, valley-bottoms (alluvial plains), and bedrock terraces (bench gravel), which have been variably buried and reworked by glaciofluvial processes. Placer gold also occurs in glacial till and glaciofluvial gravel, especially where these sediment types have intersected pre-existing placer deposits, resulting in the reconcentration of gold in a zone close to bedrock.

The Yukon has been subjected to several major episodes of glaciation, which are generally referred to as the pre-Reid (oldest), the Reid (intermediate), and the McConnell (youngest) glaciations. The pre-Reid glaciation consisted of multiple episodes, the earliest being at least 2.58 Ma. Although the Mayo area was heavily glaciated during the pre-Reid episodes, limited surficial deposits remain, and evidence mainly consists of erosional features and erratics at higher elevations. The subsequent Reid (approximately 300 000 years ago) and the McConnell (approximately 20 000 years ago) glaciations reworked and buried pre-existing glacial drift and alluvium, and left extensive surficial deposits. 

While the timing of the interglacial prior to the Reid is uncertain, the Koy-Yukon interglacial prior to the McConnell glaciation lasted approximately 170 000 years. The modern (Holocene) interglacial began approximately 11 000 years ago. These three interglacials have been the main placer-forming periods in the Mayo area. 

The complex stratigraphy of placer deposits in the Mayo area reflects its glacial and periglacial history. Within the glacial limit, placer deposits are best preserved near the maximum limit or terminus, where the scouring of preexisting sediment was minimal and depositional processes were dominant. Beyond the glacial limit, periglacial climatic conditions resulted in increased slope and alluvial sedimentation that buried and reworked paleoplacers.

Based on surficial mapping, stratigraphic relationships and sedimentology, several placer deposit models may be described within the Mayo area. These can be grouped into modern, interglacial, glacial or periglacial placer settings. 

Modern placers include alluvial fans, fan-deltas, alluvial plains and gulch deposits. Interglacial placer settings in the Mayo District include alluvial plains, alluvial fans and low terraces along second and third order streams and rivers, and gulches in first order tributary valleys. These are commonly buried and reworked by glacial drift and periglacial fan sediments. Glacial placer settings in the Mayo area include glacial till and glaciofluvial gravel in major valleys, the most significant of which are Reid age or older. Periglacial placers include alluvial fans in tributary valleys and fan-deltas along major water bodies including Mayo Lake. 

Placer exploration targets occur in all of the above settings, however the most significant are those that remain buried in trunk valleys, which were not post-glacially re-excavated due to base-level changes. Substantial placer gold reserves may exist in these valleys but their potential remains to be evaluated. Suggested methods include a combination of seismic surveys, overburden drilling and bulk sampling.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:24","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42077,"information","Placer geology of the Stewart River (115N&O) and part of the Dawson (116B&C) map areas, west-central Yukon, Canada","Placer gold deposits are widespread throughout the largely unglaciated Stewart River and southern part of the Dawson map areas. These deposits include the world famous Klondike goldfields, the historic Fortymile and Sixty Mile goldfields, and well known placers along Black Hills, Scroggie, Thistle and Kirkman creeks. Although the deposits have been mined for over 100 years and have produced an estimate 311 tonnes of gold, they still account for about 85% of Yukon's annual placer gold production.
The placer deposits are classified into three levels of gravel with four main units: high-level gravel, which usually forms prominent, continuous high-level terraces and is subdivided into the White Channel Gravel (which is locally subdivided into a lower White Gravel and an upper Yellow Gravel unit) and Klondike Gravel; intermediate-level gravel, which mostly forms relatively small, irregularly distributed intermediate to low-level terraces; and low-level gravel, which represents alluvium along present day creeks, gulches and rivers. The White Channel Gravel, is up to 46 m thick and characterized by a predominance of quartz clasts (which are generally more abundant in the White Gravel than in the Yellow Gravel). It is considered Early Pliocene to earliest Late Pliocene in age (~5 to 3 Ma). The Klondike Gravel, not considered an economical placer, is up to 53 m thick and is distinguished by chert clasts derived from the Ogilvie Mountains, located northeast of the map areas. It was deposited as glaciofluvial outwash during the end of the initial and most widespread of the pre-Reid glaciations, and is probably latest Early Pliocene to earliest Late Pliocene (~3 Ma). The intermediate-level gravel, the least important economically, is up to 9 m thick. The low-level gravel, historically the most important gold-bearing unit, is 5 m thick in creeks and up to 20 m thick in rivers. The intermediate-level and low-level gravel have similar amounts of quartz, igneous and metamorphic rock particles, although locally, the low-level gravel contains sedimentary rock particles. The intermediate-level gravel is thought to be Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene (~3 Ma to 750 Ka) in age and the low-level gravel is considered Late Pleistocene to Holocene in age. Practically all of the placers are fluvial in origin and were deposited primarily in braided streams that flowed parallel to the present day streams along which the deposits occur.
Gold recovered from the various levels of gravel is detrital in origin and was mainly derived from early Mesozoic auriferous quartz veins. The concentration of gold in the gravel is related to a hierarchy of physical scales: at the lithofacies scale (metres), bed roughness determined sites of gold deposition; at the element scale (tens of metres), gravel bars were preferentially enriched in gold; at the reach scale (hundreds of metres), stream gradient was an important factor; at the system scale (hundreds of kilometres), braided river environments transported large amounts of gold; and at the sequence scale (thousands of kilometres), economic placers formed initially in the high-level White Channel Gravel and later in the intermediate- and low-level gravel.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:25","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The survey operations were carried out from March 7 to May1, 2003. The nominal traverse line spacing was 800 m with control lies at 2.4 km spacing at a nominal terrain clearance of 200 m. A preplanned flight surface was calculated for this survey to minimize the control line and traverse line altitude differences. Flight path was recovered using a post flight differential Globa Positioning System, combined with a vertically mounted video camera.
After editing the survey data, the intersections of the control and traverse lines were established and differences in the magnetic values were computer analysed and manually checked to obtain the level network.

Although developed primarily from the Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) perspective, the Geological Survey of Canada and universities will help to meet these needs either independently or through partnerships with the YGS. It was developed during the spring, summer of 2004 as an internal draft that was later modified and refined through consultation with the Geological Survey of Canada and the Technical Liaison Committee to the YGS. Over the last five years, the need for geoscience information has grown and spread to a wider and wider audience. Geoscience is utilized primarily by the mining and petroleum sectors to support exploration for minerals and hydrocarbons, but it is increasingly playing a role in other industries such as forestry, fisheries and tourism. In all of these industries it is playing a role in their development and management. Decisions related to the utilization of natural resources are increasingly being made or influenced by many groups including developers, land managers planners, regulators, First Nations, and the general public. Their decisions need to be formed with accurate information about the nature and potential of resources, and the best practices in mitigating and preventing environmental damage.

Mechanisms for ponding of the lake(s) include regional glacial damming of the ancestral Yukon drainage (Glacial Lake Yukon), or local damming by alluvial fans or landslides. Sufficient evidence does not exist to effectively eliminate any of these hypotheses. Placer gravel may exist below the sandy fill in a buried segment of the pre-glacial Indian River valley near the confluence of Montana Creek.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Surficial Geology,placer potential","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:25","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

At least two, laterally extensive, massive barite horizons are interbedded with phyllite, bedded chert, sandstone and chert-pebble conglomerate of the Early Carboniferous Mount Aho formation, the lowermost unit in this succession. Samples from two barite horizons produced 34S values of +14.3 ± 0.2 (2) and +13.8 ± 0.2 (2), which are consistent with 34S values for coeval dissolved sulphate in seawater. Ambient seawater is therefore the most probable source of the sulphate in the barite. The results suggest barite precipitated from mixing of sulphate-poor hydrothermal fluids with ambient seawater rather than inversion of anoxic, stagnant, stratified basin waters.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Slide Mountain terrane,massive barite","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:25","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Beryl occurs in quartz veins and tension gashes, and is restricted to those that cut the syenite. Accessory minerals in the quartz veins include varying amounts of fluorite, siderite, calcite, allanite and ilmenite. Mineralization has been dated at 172 ± 5 Ma, using the Sm-Nd system on fluorite from several veins. Aquamarine discovered on the property is distinctive because of its deep blue colour and high Fe2+ concentration, up to 5.79 wt.% FeO.

In September 2005 erosion control structures reinforced with live willow cuttings were installed at the site. These structures consisted of earth retaining walls built to stabilize the slope failure and a flume to convey the water past the retaining walls while the willows had time to grow and strengthen the structures. In July 2006 the site was revisited. It was found that, while the earth retaining walls were intact, the flume had malfunctioned and further erosion had occurred beyond the walls.

These sites included a steep north-facing slope, a steep south-facing slope, and a lower nearly level area. All three of these areas had been recontoured and seeded in 1996-97, and there was a thick growth of grasses and clovers at the time the shrubs were planted in 2000. To determine if this thick growth interfered with the survival of the newly planted shrubs, the grasses and clover were first removed from one-half of each of the test plots. Six years after the shrubs were planted, it appears that black spruce and Alaska birch are the most successful species transplanted on the north-facing site, trembling aspen and Alaska birch the most successful on the south-facing site, and dwarf birch, prickly rose and trembling aspen the most successful on the nearly level site.

Skukum gold-silver epithermal deposits are 65 km southwest of Whitehorse in the Yukon Territory. Veins are in nearly flat-lying Eocene andesitic volcanic rocks of the Mt. Skukum Caldera Complex, part of the Sloko Volcanic Province, which unconformably overlies the Mesozoic Coast Plutonic Complex and Paleozoic to Precambrian metamorphic rocks.
Significant veins are contained in a regional halo of propylitic alteration centered on a graben in the southwestern corner of the Mt. Skukum Caldera Complex. Zones of steeply-dipping quartz-carbonate-sericite veins are associated with major faults and rhyolite dykes which bound blocks in the graben.
Electrum and native silver form fine grains which average 15 to 20 microns and locally exceed 1 mm across, in veins containing only trave amounts of sulphides. Fliuid inclusions indicate that vein minerals were deposited from fluids averaging 313°C with an average salinity of 0.7 weight percent NaCl equivalent. Primary inclusions show that depositional fluids existed under two pressure regimes: one close to hydrostatic, the other approaching lithostatic. Both indicate deposition about 470 m below paleosurface.
Oxygen and carbon isotope composition of minerals in the deposit and surrounding wall rocks indicate that depositional fluids were meteoric. Large depletions in O18 content of andesitic rocks in the deposit area indicate a minimum water: rock mass ratio of 0.81:1.
Precious metals at the Mt. Skukum deposit were emplaced at relatively low temperature, near surface, by a meteoric water dominated hydrothermal system driven by heat from associated rhyolite dykes. Gold and silver were leached from andesitic and rhyolite stocks and volcanic rocks as well as metamorphic and granitic basement, and precipitated with quartz and carbonate in permeable conduits such as fault zones, and breccia bodies.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:27","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The map areas are within the Teslin Plateau and the Boundary Ranges physiographic regions.

Cretaceous Coast Plutonic Complex and Upper Triassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Whitehorse Trough are separated by the 40 km long 140° trending ""Tally-Ho Shear Zone."" East of the shear zone, limestone containing late Upper Trassic conodonts is interbedded with volcanics previously mapped as Mesozoic volcanics, and now considered part of the Lewes River Group.

Mount Skukum and Bennett Lake are two Eocene volcanic complexes in the map area. The volcanic stratigraphy of the Skukum Complex has been reinterpreted and a number of previously unreported rhyolite porphyry plugs and related flows were mapped in other areas outside the main volcanic complexes.

U-Pb age dating of zircon concentrates from three plutons was completed. Megacrystic feldspar granodiorite, dated at 220 ± 5 Ma, intrudes the Lewes River Group volcanics. The granodiorite forms a regionally extensive northwest trending late Triassic batholith and is interpreted as the plutonic root of the Lewes River Arc. The Ibex Alaskite, a high level discordant pluton that intrudes late Cretaceous (?) felsic volcanics is 58 ± 1Ma. Mt. Anderson granite-granodiiorite is 119 ± 5 Ma.

The maps form a transect across the northern portion of Stikinia, an accreted terrane of uncertain origin. This bulletin establishes a stratigraphic nomenclature, and provides descriptions of  16 units of layered rocks that constitute Stikinia. Portions of the adjacent Cache Creek Terrane, Yukon-Tanana Terrane and the Coast Plutonic Complex are also represented and described. In addition, biostratigraphic and isotopic age constraints are provided for almost all of the units.
Stikinia is composed of several tectonic elements that indicate an episodic depositional history characteristic of an island arc environment. A newly discovered Late Paleozoic package, here call the Takhini assemblage, is defined, and represents the most northerly strata correlated as the Joe Mountain Formation. This enigmatic suite is Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic sedimentary rocks are the fill of the marginal basin known as the Whitehorse Trough.
Strata of the Whitehorse Trough Supergroup include: clasts of deformed Takhini assemblage; deep-water sediments as old as Ladinian; igneous clasts with Permian and Late Triassic isotopic dates; extensive Norian carbonates containing Tethyan faunas and phylloidal algae; Jurassic ammonites that represent almost every ammonite zone as young as Bajocian; and a mixed Tethyan-Boreal Early Jurassic faunal assemblage. 
Plutonic rocks of the region are voluminous and, with the benefit of isotopic dates, can be divided into five plutonic suites (Long Lake, Teslin, Whitehorse, Mount McIntyre, Nisling Range), which record Early Jurassic, mid-Cretaceous and Early Tertiary magmatic epochs. Post-Triassic volcanic rocks are well dated and include the Early Jurassic Nordenskiö dacite, mid-Cretaceous Mount Nansen Group (Bying Creek volcanics), Late Cretaceous Carmacks Group and the Windy-Table suite (Open Creek volcanics).
Mineral Occurences include a number of small copper-gold skarns and gold-quartz veins.

These strata, a component of the regional Selwyn Basin, are unconformably overlain by Upper Devonian Earn Group argillite, chert and chert pebble conglomerate. The latter succession contains widespread indications of stratiform Pb-Zn-barite mineralization. 
To the north the Tombstone Thrust sheet consists of highly strained Earn Group (formerly ¿Lower Schist¿) carbonaceous phyllite, felsic meta-tuff and metaclastic rocks, succeeded by Carboniferous Keno Hill quartzite, that is thickened by internal recumbent folds or thrusts in the north central part of the map area. These units host the Ag-Pb-Zn veins of the Elsa-Keno Hill camp, and contemporaneous meta-tuff that contains a volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit immediately northeast of the map area.
Jurassic (?) and Cretaceous contraction produced regionally developed penetrative fabrics and folds of various scales as well as thrust faulting. A domain of intensely developed foliation and lineation underlies the northern half of the map area, imparted during two or more phases of movement on the Tombstone Thrust.
Granitic intrusions of the 91-94 Ma Tombstone Suite crosscut regional structure. The McArther batholith parallels the Tintina Trench and is associated with copper skarns.

42221,"information","Mineral Assessment of the Tombstone Study Area, Yukon","A mineral assessment of the Tombstone study area was undertaken by the Department of Economic Development in the summer of 1998 at the request of the Department of Renewable Resources. The purpose of the mineral assessment was to produce a mineral potential map, which was to be used to assist with the finalization of the boundaries of the Tombstone Territorial Park.
Following an initial compilation, a field program was designed to document known mineral occurrences, test and improve the existing regional mapping, investigate geochemical anomalies, characterize favourable environments for mineralization, sample for lithogeochemistry, and prospect for mineralization. A field program resulted in the discovery of several new mineral occurrences, as well as the discovery of previously unmapped geological formations. Fieldwork was followed by a compilation phase that integrated the new information to the existing geoscientific data. The geology of the study area was subdivided into thirteen geological tracts. A panel of five industry and government experts, familiar with the geology, mineral occurrences and mineral deposit types to be found in the area, was convened in June 1999. Based on the final compilation and their expertise, they produced a relative ranking of all the tracts according to their potential to host mineral deposits, from highest potential to lowest.

The highest-ranking tracts are those that include, or are near the Cretaceous intrusions (Tombstone, Mount Brenner and smaller intrusions) and have strong potential for intrusion-hosted (Fort Knox-type, porphyry uranium, skarn) and intrusion-related (skarns, veins, replacement) mineralization. Other tracts demonstrate potential for Wernecke Breccia, shale-hosted nickel sulphide, ultramafic-hosted nickel and listwaenite, Carlin-type, Mississippi Valley-type or replacement lead-zinc, as well as volcanogenic mineralization.

A final boundary was adopted in December 2000; it includes land outside of the original study area. This final boundary therefore includes areas that were not assessed in this study.

Sediments have a number of geomorphic setting, including: 1) Holocene colluvium, alluvial fans and stream deposits; 2)Reid periglacial alluvial fans; and 3) pre-Reid glacial and glaciofluvial deposits.
Previous workers suggested that significant placer gold concentrations occur only in alluvium that lies either upon bedrock or glacial till. New data from this study suggest that significant amounts of placer gold also occur in the diamicton, primarily at the diamicton/bedrock contact.

It intrudes Neoproterozoic Hyland Group strata within the Dawson thrust sheet in the northernmost Selwyn Basin. Paleomagnetic determinations have isolated a stable characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) direction, in magnetite, for 237 specimens from 23 sites. The sites are in three plutonic phases, in three dykes cutting the pluton as well as their contact zones, and in the pluton¿s contact-zone skarn. The ChRM at all sites is coeval with pluton crystallization. The ChRM directions of all sites form one population with a mean direction of declination = 333.0°, inclination = 76.8° (95 = 2.6°, k = 139, N = 23), giving a paleopole of 144.9°E, 78.5°N (p = 4.5°, m = 4.8°) that is significantly different, at 95% confidence, from the coeval North American cratonic paleopole. This discordance is attributed to post-emplacement, northward displacement of at least several tens of kilometres of the Dawson thrust sheet, possibly along the Dawson thrust fault. The result is the beheading of the Deadman pluton and rotating its head as it was driven up the curved frontal ramp of the thrust fault.

The Selwyn Basin phase of evolution of the continental margin is represented by rock units that correlate with units defined in the eastern part of Selwyn Basin. Dark clastic and rare felsic metavolcanic rocks of the Deconian-Mississippian Earn Group unconformably overlie rocks of the Selwyn Basin phase and are overlain conformably by the Mississippian Keno Hill quartzite. Dark, fine-grained metaclastic rocks of unknown age locally overlie Keno Hill quartzite.
Four episodes of plutonism can be distinguished in the area, the earliest probably Early Paleozoic in age, another mid-Triassic in age, and two phases of Cretaceous granitic magmatism. Early Paleozoic bodies are typically metre-scale, fine-grained diabasic dikes and sills intruding rocks of the Hyland Group. Mid-Triassic diorite to gabbro occurs in discontinuous pods of various sizes, primarily in the Tombstone Thrust sheet where they intrude Devonian and Mississippian rocks. The most voluminous and widespread granitic rocks are the early Late Cretaceous Tombstone intrusions (92 ± 2 Ma). Typical Tombstone intrusions are weakly porphyritic, medium-grained hornblende-biotite granite to granodiorite, but they range from syenite to granodiorite and are locally peraluminous. The latest episode of granitic magmatism, the 65 ± 3 Ma McQuesten intrustions, is not yet fully delineated but includes five stocks of peroluminous potassium feldspar megocrystic granite.
Paleozoic and Mesozoic structures occur in the region. The Sprague Creek Fault, a pre-Late Cambrian normal fault, is inferred from stratigraphic relationships. A possibly Jurassic phase of shortening is represented by west-northwest-trending, south-vergent folds that pre-date Jura-Cretaceous structures. The most pervasive and important phase of deformation is Jura-Cretaceous in age and kinematically complex. The Robert Service and Tombstone thrusts and Tombstone Strain Zone formed between the Late Jurassic and early Late Cretaceous during northward and northwestward displacement of more southerly hanging wall rocks.
The McQuesten River region has numerous mineral occurrences, a long history of mining and mineral exploration and good potential for further discoveries.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:27","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

One of the lamprophyres contains abundant pseudomorphed olivine xenocrysts and xenoliths of inferred crustal and mantle affinities. Although this dike resembles kimberlite because of its abundance of mantle xenoliths and xenocrysts and its ultramafic composition, it differs from kimberlite in its abundance of phlogopite phenocrysts.

A total of 238 soil and plant amples (comprising 9 different species) were collected from Mt. Nansen, Arctic Gold and Silver, and Venus Mine tailing properties. At each property, samples were collected near the suspected point source of contamination, approximately 1-3 km away, and from background sites. Species were chosen for their ethnobotanical significance to the Little Salmon/Carmacks and the Carcross/Tagish First nations, based on interviews with Elders and other knowledgeable people. Total and inorganic arsenic concentrations were determined using ICP-MS and AAS instrumentation, and organic arsenic concentrations were calculated from the difference. 
Uptake of arsenic by plants was low compared to soil arsenic concentrations. In both plants and soil, the arsenic form was predominantly inorganic. Concentrations in berries at all three sites were low or undetectable, and are therefore considered safe to eat under Health Canada tolerable daily intake guidelines for inorganic arsenic.
At Mt. Nansen, the lichen ""caribou moss"" (Cetrarial/Cladina spp.), Bolete mushrooms (Leccinum spp.), and the medicinal shrubs willow (Saliz spp.) and Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum/L.decumbens spp.) had high mean arsenic concentrations around point sources or at sites up to 1.5 km away. These localized high concentrations will not likely affect foraging animals, given their constant movement. However, Carmacks residents could avoid gathering all species with elevated arsenic around the Mt. Nansen mining property until reclamation is complete.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:28","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42243,"information","Detoxifying Pit Lakes by Controlled Algal Blooms: Laboratory Study and Pilot Field Trial at little Creek Pond at Vangoda Pit near Faro, Yukon, Canada","When a mine closes, the open pit left behind often fills with water that washes metals from the pit walls. This water may be toxic and cannot be disharged without further treatment. This study evaluated the possibility of using algal blooms to remove toxic metals from pit lakes. The study had two components: laboratory tests and pit lake fertilization trials. The site for the field trial was Little Creek Pond, a small collection pond located at Vangorda Pit, near Faro, Yukon. The pond receives zinc-contaminated leachate from a waste rock dump and seepage from Vangorda Pit.Leachate is water that has percolated through soil or rock containing soluble substances such as zinc and that contains certain amounts of these substances in solution.
The laboratory study, using Little Creek Pond water, demonstrated that zinc could be removed by promoting an algal bloom. Its concentrations were decreased dramatically during the 56-day study (from starting concentrations of 55 mg/L down to 3 mg/L). An interesting finding was that zinc was removed if pond sediments were present, but not if they were absent. The high initial zinc concentrations may have been too toxic to allow the development of a strong algal bloom in the absence of sediments. This idea is supported by other recent studies, which reported that zinc could be removed from the water column at lower initial concentrations.
During the short field season at Little Creek Pond, good algal growth was promoted on pond sediments by addition of fertilizer. This is remarkable, considering that pond water contained over 200 mg/L, a highly toxic level. Nevertheless, zinc removal was not shown in the field trial. This may be partially explained by the short time abailable to produce the algal blooms and the fact that metal laden waters were continuously seeping into Little Creek Pond during the study. Our attempt to determine if zinc removal still occurred was frustrated by our inability to calculate an accurate water balance. This was due to a lack of reliable data on seepage flows and zinc concentrations, on water volumes in the pond, and on other possible inputs into the pond from groundwater.
A single measurement of zinc content in harvested algae (over 12g per kg wet weight) indicates that zinc was successfully absorbed by algae growing on sediments. However, this provides insufficient information to conclude that significant zinc removal occurred.
Despite these qualified results, aquatic phytoremediation appears to be a promising, low cost alternative to conventional lime treatment which has been used at mine sites in the past. We recommend that further studies be undertaken in pit lakes that contain lower zinc concentrations, such as the Grum pit, near Faro, Yukon.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:28","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

However, the presence of largescale angle of repose foresets of large- to small-pebble conglomerate, with distinct down-slope termination in laminated mudrocks, indicates that at least some >5 m foresets were formed by episodic flood-controlled progradation of a small river-dominated lobate delta. Architectural analysis of exposures at the Whitehorse Coal deposit, 26 km south-southwest of Whitehorse, indicates periodic rapid progradation into a small lake that was at least 6 m deep. Thinning and downlap of some foreset units indicate shifting location of topset distributary channels. Down-slope transition of gravel foresets into thin sub-horizontal beds of massive and graded sandstone and pebbly sandstone suggests that the foresets were inertia-dominated.

The distribution of these shallow landslides was mapped in the Mickey Creek, Steele Creek and Fifty Mile Creek watersheds. Selected slope failures were surveyed in detail to describe their geometry and geomorphological settings in order to investigate the mechanisms of failure, and to assess the effects of the forest fires on local permafrost conditions. The failures generally initiated on moderate convex slopes at shallow depths (< 65 cm ) in silty colluvium; frost tables were close to 1 m in depth. Most active-layer detachments
were on the order of 5-20 m wide and 10-100 m long and occurred on slopes with a variety of aspects; however, the detachments occurred only where permafrost was present. In some cases, they developed on gentle slopes (as low as 10°) and traveled several hundred metres, depositing sediment directly into creeks, or across access trails. Their cumulative effects may significantly impact sediment transport within the watersheds.

Mineralization is thought to have a genetic association with nearby Cretaceous plutons, which were important in the formation of most mineralization in the TGB. However, an evaluation of the Hyland River occurrences indicates that evidence supporting an intrusion-related gold model is mostly lacking. Plutons and dykes do not occur in the vicinity of the gold occurrences; there are no obvious zones of hornfels; contact metamorphic minerals and skarns are mostly absent; there is no known mineral or metal zonation typical of intrusion-related systems; and aeromagnetic lows result from massive, variably altered quartz grit and conglomerate and not from unroofed `low-mag' intrusions. Mineralization consists of four types: 1) disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite in altered grit; 2) quartz-arsenopyrite veins; 3) quartz-pyrite-galena veins; and, 4) massive arsenopyrite veins.

A similar scenario exists in the Wernecke and Ogilvie Mountains of the Yukon where Mesoproterozoic Pinguicula Group strata unconformably overlie
Paleoproterozoic Wernecke Supergroup metasedimentary rocks. Uranium occurs in veins that cut Wernecke Supergroup rocks, most notably in association with Wernecke Breccia ¿ a large-scale Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic breccia system. Ages returned by uranium minerals are significantly younger than the ages of the host strata and may be reflecting mobilization of uranium during later tectonic and/or thermal events.

Its objective is to provide information on gemstone deposit geology and provide general guidelines for the identification of, and exploration for, gemstone occurrences. The report focuses on a selection of some of the most valuable gemstones in the global gem trade: ruby, sapphire, emerald, chrysoberyl, tsavorite garnet, tanzanite and the gem minerals (topaz, aquamarine, tourmaline) found in permatites or rhyolites. Exploration criteria for other gemstones such as opal, nephrite jade, jadeite jade, zircon, lapis lazuli and rhondonite are beyond the scope of this report.
For each gem mineral covered in this report, background information is introduced and the physical and chemical characteristics of the gem are presented. The geology and genesis of each gem deposit type is summarized and exploration guidelines are listed. One of the difficulties in developing exploration guidelines is that many of the world's gem deposits are unique.

42273,"information","Sedimentology, stratigraphy and source rock potential of the Richthofen formation (Jurassic), northern Whitehorse Trough, Yukon","Whitehorse Trough is a frontier basin in south-central Yukon that is thought to contain gas and possibly oil. It formed in the early Triassic as an arc-marginal basin between the ancient North American margin to the east and the volcano-plutonic Stikine Terrane to the west. Three stratigraphic units, termed the Lewes River Group (Upper Triassic), the Laberge Group (Lower-Middle Jurassic) and the Tantalus Formation (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous), are recognized in the Whitehorse Trough. The Laberge Group is informally subdivided into four units, which, from the base upwards includes the Richthofen, Conglomerate, Nordenskiold and Tanglefoot formations. The Richthofen formation in the Laberge map area (NTS 105E) is characterized by thin- to mediumbedded turbidites, massive sandstone, matrix- and clast-supported conglomerate, scarce ammonites and belemnites, and abundant trace fossils, particularly Chondrites. No comprehensive stratigraphic section exists for the Richthofen formation, but it is estimated to be at least 500 m thick and appears to consist of a lower clast-supported conglomerate unit, a middle unit dominated by thin- to-medium bedded turbidites with minor amounts of massive sandstone and clast- and matrix-supported conglomerate, and an upper clast-supported conglomerate unit. The Richthofen formation unconformably overlies the Lewes River Group and was deposited by a southeast-prograding submarine fan (or fans) during the Early Jurassic. It is correlative with the Inklin Formation in northwestern British Columbia. Programmed pyrolysis using Rock-Eval 6 analysis of 63 samples from the Richthofen formation indicates that it is a poor to fair source rock and is gas-prone.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,hydrocarbon potential,hydrocarbon resources","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:28","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42274,"information","Natural Attenuation of Aqueous Zinc in Shallow Soils over Permafrost Downslope of Galkeno 300 mine Adit, United Keno hill Mines, central yukon","This study investigated the natural attenuation of zinc in mine drainage at the Galkeno 300 mine site, located at the northern  limit of the discontinuous permafrost zine in central Yukon Territory. The mine drainage contains ~150 mg/L Zn where it exits the mine; where these same waters enter the receiving environment of Christal Creek, the Zn concentrations have been reduced to ~2 mg/L. The research program examining this natural attenuation consisted of two phases. Phase 1 was comprised of a site investigation along with the collection of samples for chemical analyses and laboratory testing. Phase 2 consisted of laboratory characterisation and testing of samples collected during Phase 1.
The Phase 1 site investigation was carried out during summer 2000. A climate station was established to monitor precipitation and temperature during the study period. Site water balance was monitored through the erection of two weirs; input exceeded outputs by and averages of 16%, indicating a minor degree of dilution. Water samples collected at sites along the longitudinal mine drainage flowpath showed no temporal trends, but clearly outlined a dramatic decrease in Zn concentrations with distance from the adit. Soil samples of upper organic and lower mineral horizons were collected from within and immediately adjacent to the flowpath. Chemical analysis of aliquots of these samples clearly showed elevation of Zn concentrations in samples in contact with mine drainage; upper organic horizons samples in particular were found to contain highly anamalous Zn levels.
The Phase 2 laboratory investigation subjected the collected samples to physical and chemical characterisation, as well as batch adsorption testing and column leaching with synthetic and natural mine drainage. Batch adsorption tests showed the organic soils to have the highest Zn attenuation capacity; in particular, organic soils from the midpoint of the site (site C) were found to have the highest adsorptivity. Similar results were obtained in the column leaching and desorption test; organic samples from site C had both the highest Zn attenuation capacity and and the greatest degree of Zn retention under increasingly aggressive desorbing conditions. 
Selective extractions of the collected soils showed that the oxide fraction was the repository for much of the soil zinc. In the organic sils in particular, the oxide fraction dominates the geochemical fractionation of Zn in Galkeno 300 soils. High concentrations of Mn are removed form the mine drainage simultaneously with Zn; the coprecipitation of Mn-Zn oxides appears to be the dominant process of natural attenuation of Zn at the Galkeno 300 site.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:28","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

They are correlated with Lower Mississippian and older strata in the Glenlyon and Finlayson Lake areas. Yukon-Tanana rocks are intruded by at least five plutonic suites, ranging in age from Late Devonian to Late Cretaceous. The structural style of the area is dominated by a transposition foliation which is axial planar to isoclinal folds of an earlier foliation. The transposition foliation is itself folded by northeast-verging open folds. The d'Abbadie fault zone, a 1-km-wide zone of imbricate fault slices in
the eastern part of the area, is characterized by multiple generations of ductile fabrics overprinted by younger cataclastic breccia zones. Deformation along d¿Abbadie fault is in part constrained by syn-tectonic emplacement of a ca. 96 Ma granite pluton along the western margin of the fault zone. Two new showings are reported here: a Pb-Ag vein occurrence and a pyrrhotite skarn.

It is hosted by quartz-chlorite-actinolite schist derived from (probable) Devono-Mississippian-aged mafic volcanic rocks. Overlying the deposit are intercalated metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. This mixed sequence is, in turn, overlain by a thick sequence of graphitic phyllite. The deposit consists of three northwest-trending stratiform lenses comprising massive and semi-massive sulphide and magnetite iron formation. Pyrite is the dominant sulphide mineral in the deposit, with lesser amounts of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and locally, sphalerite. The sulphide mineralization is copper and cobalt-rich and locally contains significant concentrations of zinc and gold. It has low to trace amounts of lead, barium, arsenic, antimony, tin and selenium.
Lithogeochemical results indicate that the host mafic metavolcanic rocks are strongly depleted of light rare-earth elements (LREE) and high field strength elements (HFSE), and contain elevated levels of MgO, Ni and Cr. SiO2 in the host rocks ranges from 53 to 58%. Chemically, the mafic metavolcanic rocks are similar to boninitic rocks found in some suprasubduction zone ophiolites such as those at Cyprus. The primitive boninitic chemistry of the host metavolcanic rocks implies that they originated as melts from a depleted mantle in a rifted setting. The presence of felsic metasedimentary rocks below, within and overlying the host metavolcanic rocks suggests that the Fyre Lake deposit was formed in or near a mature tectonic setting, possibly a continental arc or an evolved island arc. The host mafic metavolcanic rocks are chemically distinct from other mafic and intermediate metavolcanic rocks that outcrop on the Fyre Lake property. A clastic metavolcanic rock unit lies stratigraphically below the deposit. It consists of fragmental LREE and HFSE-enriched transitional subalkaline basalts. Other discontinuous bodies of metavolcaniclastic and metaflow rocks occur stratigraphically above and peripheral to the Fyre Lake deposit. These are enriched in LREE and Th, and relatively depleted in Nb, Ta and Ti, and generally display the chemical features of transitional basalts and andesites erupted in a continental arc or evolved island arc setting.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:28","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42286,"information","A regional characterization of landslides in the Alaska Highway corridor, Yukon","The following report describes the settings, causes and geological controls of landslides in the Alaska Highway corridor. Although diverse geologic, geomorphic and climatic environments exist in the region, most landslides are related to the presence of shallow bedrock or permafrost, unconsolidated sediment on steep slopes, weak bedrock, groundwater hydrology, river erosion or the degradation of ice-rich permafrost. Where geologic controls provide appropriate settings, intense rainfall, rapid snow melt and seismic events play important roles in triggering failures. Rainstorms that reach thresholds of combined intensity and duration have triggered abundant shallow landslides within the corridor. Debris flows have historically posed the highest risk to lowlying regions and are capable of damaging settlements and transportation routes.

The Shakwak Valley has the highest concentration of landslides within the corridor due to the abundance of steep slopes, high relief and widespread discontinuous permafrost. In Wellesley Depression, shallow permafrost and its subsidence has an important influence on slope instabilities. Landslides in the Yukon Plateau primarily relate to the presence of silt- and ice-rich tills on steep valley sides as well as the incision of fine-grained lacustrine terraces in valley bottoms. Debris flows after intense rainfall events are the most common form of landslide in the Kaska Mountains. Finally, in Liard Lowland, failures associated with glacial meltwater and modern stream incision are the most common landslide events.

Permafrost plays an important role in landslide processes in the corridor due to its influence on soil moisture, drainage and strength. Slopes composed of icy sediment that have been burned by forest fires are particularly vulnerable to rapid mass movements due to permafrost degradation. The consequences of the dramatic increase in landslide potential after fire should be considered in local fire management plans. The climate¿s local and regional influence on hydrology, fire frequency and permafrost distribution greatly affects landslide processes. Current climate change projections call for warmer temperatures and increased precipitation for the Yukon in the next half century. Among the anticipated effects of global warming in southern Yukon, increased incidents of intense snowmelt and/or precipitation events, river migration, permafrost degradation or forest fires may lead to an increase in landslide frequency and/or magnitude within the settings described in this report. The most significant impact of increased landslide activity may not be a direct impact. Rather, increased sediment input from landslides will
likely increase stream channel instability and flooding. This would be particularly acute in the vicinity of alluvial and colluvial fan complexes along Kluane Lake where highway maintenance is already a challenge.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:29","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42315,"information","Geology of the White River Native Copper Deposits, Yukon (115F)","The White River copper deposit, in upper Triassic Nikolai Greenstone of southwestern Yukon, is representative of the native copper-basalt association. Native copper and chalcocite are the association. Native copper and chalcocite are the most abundant ore minerals, but a substantial amount of bornite is known, as well as lesser amounts of chalcopyrite, pyrite, digenite, covellite, cuprite and native silver. These minerals are found in crosscutting fractures, amygdules, gas release tubes, small crackle zones, and as local disseminations in basalt; and although concentrated near the margins of a single glomeroporphyritic unit, are neither confined to that unit nor to a single zone within it.

Two stages of copper mineralization are postulated: Stage I mineralization is thought to account for most of the native copper as a product of continental weathering of Nikolai basalts. Stage II mineralization is a much later event characterized by copper sulphides in crosscutting structures.

Native copper and copper sulphides of Stage II appear to form a stable and primary product of a low grade (regional) metamorphism indicated by such minerals as chlorite, epidote, prehnite, pumpellyite, calcite analcite and apophyllite which have essentially the same mode of occurrence as primary copper minerals. Consequently, metamorphism (prehnite-pumpellyite facies) is interpreted to have been the mineralizing process. Whole-rock potassium-argon dating suggests an age no older than 120 million years for the metamorphic mineralizing event; hence, stage II mineralization post-dated host rock formation by at least 80 million years. It is probabe that many other copper occurrences in Nikolai Greenstone have formed in a similar manner. Also, it is likely that some of these mineralizing fluids could have moved higher in the stratigraphic sequence and precipitated copper minerals in other units.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:29","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42316,"information","Yukon Geoscience - Looking to the Next Millennium","Four years after the first Yukon Geoscience Planning Workshop (the Marsh Lake Workshop, Yukon Geoscience - A Blueprint for the Future, Yukon Geology Program, March, 1995), forty-two representatives of industry, academia, and government met at the High Country Inn in Whitehorse to re-examine the state of Yukon geoscience. Over two days, with the expert facilitation of Steve Morison, Gartner Lee Ltd., the participants reviewed the first plan, the work that was done since 1995, and produced a new set of priorities to guide Yukon geoscience into the next millenium. The 1999 Yukon Geoscience Planning Workshop had a format similar to the 1995 workshop and many of the original participants were able to attend. This continuity greatly added to the quality and credibility of the input.

42320,"information","A Progress Report on Stratigraphic Investigations of the Lowermost Succession of Proterozoic Rocks, Northern Wernecke Mountains, Yukon","This interim report has reviewed stratigraphic characteristics of the lowermost succession of Proterozoic rocks exposed in the northern Wernecke Mountains. This sequence of rocks, which is in excess of 13 km thick, is named the Wernecke Supergroup. The Wernecke Supergroup is composed of three groups which from oldest to youngest are given the informal names Fairchild Lake Group, Quartet Group and Gillespie Lake Group. Several tentative subdivisions of formational status have been described in each of these groups.

The Fairchild Lake Group is composed of at least 4 km of generally light grey weathering siltstones, slates and argillites. It is divided into four formations, two of which contain carbonate members:: one formation near the middle of the group, contains ribbed weathering, thinly bedded, siltstone-limestone rhythmites; the other formation at the top of the group consists of interbedded shaly siltstone and dolostone with a distinctive white weathering limestone marker horizon. The Quartet Group, which conformably overlies the Fairchild Lake Group, consists of up to 5 km of monotonous dark grey weathering siltstone, argillite and slate with minor sandstone. The Quartet Group is transitional into the overlying Gillespie Lake Group which is compposed of at least 4 km buff to orange to locally grey weathering dolostone with minor siltstone and sandstone.

Metamorphism, faulting, complex folds, the monotonous and cyclical nature of stratigraphy, the lack of distinctive marker horizons and the possibility of facies changes have greatly hindered attempts at stratigraphic reconstruction in rocks of the Wernecke Supergroup. Thus much of the stratigraphic detail within the groups must be considered tentative in nature. Field investigations to be undertaken during the summer of 1978 will help further refine the stratigraphic relationships outlined above.

An Appendix to this report contains 19 representative stratigraphic sections which illustrate the main features of these rocks and a 1::250 000 location map showing where the sections are from.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:29","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

It shows that the deposits occur within MacMillan Fold Belt, an anomalous west-trending feature made up of three parallel elongate domains called the North, Central and South Blocks. Each is characterized by distinctive styles of deformation and Devonian strata.
The North Block is characterized by a thick Early and Middle Devonian chert and shale sequence included in the Lower Earn Group and by an intricate array of southerly directed thrust faults. The Central Block includes unusually thick Early and Middle Devonian silty limestone intercalated with volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks within the upper part of the Road River Group. The Tom and Jason sedimentary exhalative zinc-lead-silver-barite deposits are associated with a thick sequence of coarse clastic rocks thought to belong to a submarine fan complex within the Lower Earn Group. Tight, upright folds, high angle reverse faults and irregularly oriented faults are characteristic.

In the South Block, the Lower Earn Group comprises a thin Devonian shale sequence. Open upright folds and few faults are the structural style. The differences in Devonian strata and contrasting style of deformation between blocks may reflect older (Devonian?) fault control to depositional patterns, but structures of that age have not been identified.

Mafic to ultramafic rocks occur within the upper part of the Permian section and in the Triassic flows. Folding and faulting of this sequence is intense.

The ultramafic rocks are peridotite-dunite complexes in the form of sills. Some gabbroic bodies have intruded along sill boundaries, but most are separate sills or dykes. Nowhere have they been found cutting rocks younger than the upper Triassic volcanics.

Ni-Cu mineralization is spatially associated with the gabbros and peridotites. Dunite portions of ultramafic complexes are barren. Sulphide minerals include pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite, locally with pyrite, sphalerite and galena. Occurrences are classified as follows::

1. Massive to stringer within country rock adjacent to gabbro intruding peridotite.
2. Massive to heavily disseminated at the country rock contact of gabbro intruding peridotite.
3. A) Heavily disseminated to nearly massive within gabbro intruding peridotite.
B) Disseminated within separate gabbroic bodies.
4. Very weakly disseminated within peridotite.

The mineralized gabbro-ultramafic intrusions are spatially related to the Triassic volcanic flows. The mafic and ultramafic rocks, their Ni-Cu deposits, and volcanic flows are believed to be related genetically.

Gold levels ranged from <0.03 to 0.33 g/t, and averaged 0.08 g/t. Pre-concentration of the gold by screening at 4 mesh was successful in upgrading gold levels by an average of 2.4 times, without gold loss. The average grade of the -4 mesh product was 0.19 g/t Au.

Use of gravity concentration principally as an analytical method (i.e., to upgrade gold for more reliable analysis) and, secondly, as a potential processing method, was not successful as only three samples yielded high gold recoveries.

Metallurgical evaluation of selected samples was completed. Bottle rolls and column tests with cyanide yielded maximum gold extractions of greater than 65%. Cyanide consumptions were less than 1.2 kg/t of leach feed. More testwork is required to confirm extractions and to further develop agglomeration procedures.

Sampling was a problem due to the low grade of the material and the discrete nature of the gold particles, which may result in the heterogenous segregation of the gold during the sampling and assay procedures. These effects are more commonly known as the ""nugget"" effect. A more suitable method of assaying the feed would be to leach the material with cyanide, and calculate a head assay from the leach products.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:30","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42365,"information","Preliminary Metallogenic Maps of Yukon","Preliminary metallogenic maps for Yukon were produced by combining information from the newly released digital geology map of Yukon (Gordey and Makepeace, 1999) and the Yukon Minfile (1997) database. The maps are presented as a series of eleven time slices divided as follows: Early and Middle Proterozoic, Late Proterozoic, Late Proterozoic to Early Cambrian, Cambrian to Early Devonian, Devonian to Mississippian, Pennsylvanian to Permian, Triassic to Jurassic, Early and mid-Cretaceous, Late Cretaceous, and Tertiary. Each map shows the geology of the particular time slice and the mineral occurrences of that age. The mineral occurrences have been classified according to mineralization type and main commodity/commodities.

The maps for the Mesozoic and Tertiary have been subdivided into types of mineral occurrences. For example, there are five maps for the Early to mid-Cretaceous, the first of which shows all mineral occurrences; the remaining four maps show porphyry, skarn, vein, and carbonate-hosted occurrences, respectively. In addition, coal occurrences and deposits, regardless of age, are shown on the last map of the series entitled ""coal-bearing strata"".

The metallogenic maps show the distribution of metals and reveal which rock units have known mineral potential. They highlight the fact that most of the Yukon remains an exploration frontier with significant potential. This is illustrated by the recent discovery of volcanic-associated massive sulphide (VMS) deposits in the Finlayson Lake district and significant new discoveries of intrusion-related gold systems (IRGS) mineralization in the ""Tombstone Gold Belt"", and also, the recent discovery of emeralds in rocks not previously known to have gemstone potential. In addition to hard rock mineralization, Yukon also contains numerous placer gold deposits.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,metallogeny","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:30","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42366,"information","Possible Mechanisms of Natural Attenuation of Metal-bearing Waters in Soils in Northern Climates","Mining of metallic ores exposes metal-bearing minerals in wall rock, tailings, and waste rock to accelerated rates of weathering; this can lead to increased metal loading to the environment. Waters draining natural exposures of metalliferous rocks and rocks exposed through mining or mineral exploration commonly contain high concentrations of metals.

For natural attenuation processes to mitigate the effects of increased rates of metallic mineral weathering on the environment, it is necessary that metals removed from metalliferous waters be stored in a form that is stable over the range of conditions which exist at the attenuating site. Long term storage of metals is essential for natural attenuation processes to be of any practical value. Short term storage (e.g., seasonal retention) may result in periods of metal accumulation followed by large metal fluxes to the receiving environment over a short time period resulting from changes in site conditions (e.g., seasonal changes such as high spring flows). Understanding the temporal stability of different forms of metal storage and the processes by which natural attenuation in soils occurs will allow more accurate estimates of metal fluxes to the receiving environment. This knowledge may also prove beneficial in the design of passive water treatment systems for northern mines and exploration sites.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:30","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

It is currently proposed that Selkirk First Nation will add this SMA to their Final Agreement. The Habitat Protection Area designation does not require the withdrawal of the area from mineral staking and withdrawal has not been requested in the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the governments of Canada and Yukon and the First Nations. The purpose of this report is to present the results of the detailed mineral assessment of an approximately 1094 km2 area that encompassed the proposed Special Management Area. This enlarged area was included to provide some relative context for the assessment. The proposed area has no known mineral occurrences and although it was not the focus of the 2002 fieldwork, work conducted during 2002 did not identify any new mineral resources. The detailed mineral assessment is based on the mineral potential of the geology as identified by a panel of industry experts. The detailed mineral assessment map indicates that a belt of rocks crossing the northwestern portion of the proposed Special Management Area has the highest relative mineral potential. This area is underlain by Windy McKinley Terrane (WMT). The WMT is composed of an oceanic assemblage of ultramafic rocks, greenstone, chert, carbonate, and metamorphosed equivalents. The WMT was determined to have the highest relative mineral potential by the assessment panel conducting the detailed mineral assessment of the Wellesley study area. The assessment panel determined that the WMT has potential for hosting volcanic massive sulfide volcanogenic type, gabbroic nickel-copper and gold-quartz vein deposits. The Carmacks volcanic rocks in the southern portion of the proposed Special Management Area have potential for epithermal type deposits. Field work in 2002 located an area with anomalous gold, arsenic and antimony values in soil and stream sediment samples in the WMT just outside the proposed SMA boundary. Two soil samples collected from within the proposed SMA, from an area underlain by Carmacks Group basalts, yielded weakly anomalous gold values. Further evaluation work is recommended for the higher elevations where there is potential for rock formations to outcrop.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:30","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42380,"information","An Analysis of Sluicebox Riffle Performance","The sluicebox is still the most popular placer gold recovery device in the Yukon because of its simplicity, reliability, low cost and very high concentration ratio. A sluicebox is a rectangular flume containing riffles on matting, through which a dilute slurry of water and alluvial gravel flows.

Two field sampling programs sponsored by the Klondike Placer Miners Association (Clarkson, 1989, 1990) provided valuable data regarding the gold recovery efficiency of a variety of sluiceboxes. However, they also posed many questions which could not be answered without resorting to testing under more controlled pilot-scale conditions.

A pilot scale testing facility was constructed at the Yukon College in Whitehorse. It used a gravel pump and cyclone to continuously cycle -1/2 inch placer gravel through an 8 feet by 6 inch wide sluice run. The sluice run was constructed with Plexiglass sides to allow visual interpretation. Several sizes, types, spacings and orientations of riffles were tested under a variety of feed rates, water rates and sluice run slopes to determine the optimal scour and deposition patterns.

Once the optimum conditions had been observed, the feed was salted with irradiated gold particles to confirm the riffle's effectiveness. In addition, the effects of Monsanto matting, suspended punch plate and the screening efficiency of stationary punch plate were also investigated.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:30","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42381,"information","Biological Detoxification of Cyanide in Northern Environments","MERG (Mining Environment Research Group) and Viceroy's Brewery Creek Mine commissioned a study by Microbial Technologies Inc., to determine the viability of biological detoxification of spent heaps in Northern (Arctic) environments. This approach has been applied at a small number of mine sites in North America, but it remains a relatively unproven technology. In particular, the detoxifying ability of microorganisms indigenous to Northern mine sites remained to be demonstrated. This approach may be advantageous for the Yukon Territory because it relies on bacteria grown on site to destroy cyanide, as compared with importing (potentially large quantities) of hydrogen peroxide.

The study was designed to answer two questions::
1) Is biological detoxification a feasible option for Brewery Creek Mine?
2) Is this process likely to be applicable to other similar operations in the Yukon Territory and other Northern locations?

There is virtually no information on the abundance and distribution of bacteria capable of degrading cyanide in the Arctic. It is known that different bacterial species degrade different metal-cyanide complexes, such as iron-cyanide or nickel-cyanide complexes. Thus, it is important to determine both the abundance and the metabolic diversity of micro-organisms metabolizing metal-cyanide complexes. The first phase of the study involved collecting, enumerating, and culturing such micro-organisms from the mine sites.

Cyanide-degrading bacteria may be present in the mine environment, but they may not be able to detoxify the ore from the spent heap. For example, they may be incapable of colonizing the ore or they may be inhibited by high cyanide concentrations or some toxicant in the ore (e.g., arsenic, mercury). Phase 2 of the study was a column study to determine if bacteria collected and grown in Phase 1 can detoxify spent ore collected from Brewery Creek's heap. Their ability to destroy cyanide was compared with that of hydrogen peroxide, the conventional chemical treatment of spent heaps.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:30","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The Paleozoic and older(?) Nisling Terrane is composed of the quartz-rich Nisling assemblage, the carbonaceous Nasina assemblage and orthogneiss assumed to be Devono-Mississippian in age. The Nakina sub-terrane of the northern Cache Creek Terrane is composed of Mississippian to Permian spilitized basalt, ultramafite, chert and limestone characterized by Tethyan faunal assemblages and dramatic facies variations. The northern Stikine Terrane is composed of the Upper Triassic Lewes River arc and its plutonic roots.

Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic sedimentary rocks of the Lewes River and Laberge groups collectively comprise the Whitehorse Trough overlap assemblage. Basal augite-phyric volcanic rocks of the Lewes River Group (Povoas Fm) are unconformably overlain by sedimentary debris derived from the eroding arc (Aksala Fm). These rocks are disconformably overlain by Laberge Group coarse clastics (Takwahoni Fm) deposited in laterally discontinuous submarine fans and conformably overlain by distal fine-grained equivalents (Inklin Fm). Siliciclastic rocks of the Tantalus Formation were deposited in a variety of marine environments in a successor basin to the Whitehorse Trough during Upper Jurassic and Late Cretaceous(?) times.

Plutonic rocks cover approximately 40% of the project area and comprise over 30 individual bodies with a wide range of compositions. Plutonic rocks have been divided into six chrono-lithologically distinct suites: Late Triassic batholiths of the Klotassin plutonic suite; Early Jurassic syn-tectonic(?) foliated diorite; mid-Cretaceous granodiorite of the Whitehorse plutonic suite; mid-Cretaceous granophyric quartz monzonite of the Mount McIntyre plutonic suite; a poorly defined suite of Late Cretaceous intrusions with associated volcanism; and quartz-rich high-level Late Paleocene/Early Eocene intrusions of the Nisling Range Plutonic Suite which form the plutonic roots to Skukum Group volcanism. The Klotassin suite is assumed to form the plutonic roots to the Lewes River arc, but are isotopically dissimilar. The Bennett Granite provides a Late Triassic link between Nisling Terrane and Lewes River arc. Cretaceous and Tertiary intrusions are peraluminous and comprise the Coast Plutonic Complex.

Isolated but widespread accumulations of intermediate mid- and Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks form the Mt. Nansen and Carmacks groups. Four Late Paleocene/Early Eocene volcanic complexes of the Skukum Group are aligned in a northerly trend and represent deeper levels of erosion to the north. Skukum Group activity is also represented by numerous northeast-trending rhyolite dyke swarms representative of a transtensional regime.

Strata of the Whitehorse Trough were deformed into a set of open to tight, northwest-trending folds during Middle and(?) Latest Jurassic/Early Cretaceous compressional event(s). In northern Cache Creek Terrane, much of the deformation took place during Middle Jurassic terrane accretion, but Late Cretaceous southerly verging thrust faults are documented. Nisling Terrane metasedimentary rocks were metamorphosed prior to the intrusion of the Late Triassic Bennett Granite.

The Tally Ho shear zone is a narrow domain of penetrative, ductile deformation with evidence of Late Triassic, sinistral strike-slip displacement. It strikes northwest and dips steeply and marks the easternmost limit of Nisling Terrane exposures. It may represent a terrane boundary between the Lewes River arc and the Nisling Terrane; alternatively it may be a transpressional structure within the arc itself.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:31","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42426,"information","Testing the Viability of Floater Dredging in Frozen Ground","This report is an account of our work testing the viability of floater dredging for placer gold in permafrost. Floater dredging is a method of mining which uses a hydraulic excavator to feed placer gravel to a floating gravel processing plant. We wanted to see if the digging face of a dredge pond dug in permafrost would thaw fast enough to supply gravel for a production-scale mining operation.

We stripped the vegetation and muck from an area on a permafrost terrace above the Fortymile River. We dug a pit in the stripped area and pumped it full of water to form a pond in which to operate our floater dredge. Water from the pond seeped into the surrounding gravel, thawing as it penetrated.

We confirmed that when frozen gravel is exposed to water, it thaws faster than when exposed to air. We experimented with various methods of accelerating the rate of thaw at the dredging cut face. We found that sloping the cut face at 30° to the vertical exposed more surface area to the thawing action of the water, without sacrificing digging efficiency of the excavator. We found that equipping the excavator with spade-type abrasion teeth gave the best combination of penetration, digging efficiency, and wear.

Towards the end of the experiment, we found that water had penetrated at least 12 feet back from the cut face. We believe that the artificial water-table, created by seepage from the pond, may have started thawing large blocks of the permafrost. Further work is required to test this theory.

We found that the cut face thawed back at a rate of at least 2 feet in 24 hours. With a long enough face, this would provide enough thawed gravel to support a production-scale operation. A 600-foot cut face is required for a 100 yd/hour operation over a 10-hour sluicing day. The gravel did not thaw at an even rate along the face, and we dug more gravel in the thawed areas, causing the face to become uneven. This made mining difficult because the cut became disorganized. The solution to this problem was to even the cut face by using a dozer to push thawed material from the stripped area in front of the face into the sections of the cut where the deepest advances had been made. Using this technique, we were able to dredge the frozen ground successfully on a sustainable basis.

Floater mining offers an option to miners working permafrost deposits. However, because there are factors limiting its applicability, a careful analysis should be made before committing resources to this type of operation.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:31","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42441,"information","Gold Losses at Klondike Placer Mines - Gold Recovery Project (Phase 1)","Placer mining has made significant contributions to both the history and lifestyle of the Yukon and continues to provide a stable non-governmental economic force. This year there are approximately 185 active placer mining operations with a combined reported contribution in excess of $65 million to the Yukon's small resource based economy. Placer gold recovery at many of these operations is not optimized due to a lack of access to current technology, training and testing facilities.

Current gold recovery technology is almost exclusively confined to sluice boxes. A limited number of operations additionally employ feeders and screens. Sluice boxes are very simple, reliable, inexpensive, and yield very high concentration ratios. Many factors contribute to improved recoveries with a sluice box including:

a) Controlled feed rates at less than 8 loose cubic yards/hr per foot of sluice width;
b) screened pay gravels to at least 3/4 of an inch;
c) adequate washing and liberation of free gold particles;
d) water ratio of 17 Imperial gallons/minute per loose cubic yard of pay gravels/hr;
e) use of both expanded metal and Hungarian riffles in every sluice run;
f) utilization of a slick plate section before a riffle section to allow gold segregation in the slurry;
g) even feeding through automation or strict manual control of loading equipment;
h) sluice box gradients of between 1.5 and 2 inches/foot; and
i) frequent removal of sluicebox concentrates for upgrading.

Suiceboxes can recover up to 95% of gold particles as fine as 150 mesh provided that the precious conditions are realized. Sluiceboxes may not be adequate for placer deposits containing very fine pay gravel with abundant clay and fine silt, a high proportion of high density minerals, or extrememly fine (-150 mesh) or flattened gold particles. For a White Channel deposit, an oscillating sluicebox kept riffles from packing and provided reasonable gold recovery.

Sampling design is critical for placer gold testwork because test results can be distorted by the ""nugget"" effect. The uneven distribution of gold particles in a placer deposit often produces large random sampling errors. A sluice tailings stream represents one of the easiest sampling locations, provided the samples are caught in the air.

Sluice tailings samples were collected from six operating Yukon mines at regular intervals with hand held buckets, sample cutters, or a large steel box depending on the coarseness of the discharge. The samples which represented between 1.5 and 7 loose cubic yards, were screened at 16 mesh and shipped to a tabling facility.

At each site, a large number of sample increments were alternately stored in two containers as interpenetrating samples over a period of 2 to 4 days. Comparison of these two samples indicated relative standard deviations (coefficient of variation) as low as 8%.These errors soared 56% (nugget effect) for two sites with high losses, when a limited number of gold particles as coarse as 14 mesh were found in their tailings.

To evaluate gold recovery efficiency, the collection of head samples is an impratical task as well as being of dubious value. At each operation, the sluice boxes were cleaned directly before and after the sampling period. A calculated head grade was determined by adding the gold recovered in the sluicebox and the gold lost to the tailings. The placer gold data recorded over the 2 to 4 day sampling periods represent only a snapshot of a total deposit's characteristics.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:31","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42445,"information","Geology of Mt. Nansen (115I/3) and Stoddart Creek (115I/6), Dawson Range, Central Yukon","The Mount Nansen and Stoddart Creek map areas (NTS 115 I/3, 6) are in the southern part of the Dawson Range. They contain a number of porphyry and vein related mineral occurrences which have been undergoing extensive re-evaluation for precious metals potential. Basement rocks are part of the Yukon Crystalline Terrane and include metamorphosed and deformed sedimentary, volcanic and plutonic rocks of uncertain age. These are intruded by two suites of foliated plutonic rocks, the Upper Triassic to Jurassic Klotassin Suite, mainly hornblende-biotite granodiorite, and the Jurassic Big Creek Suite, including K-feldspar porphyritic syenite, quartz syenite and monzonite. Latest metamorphism of basement rocks is likely related to emplacement of these suites.

Latest lower Cretaceous was marked by intrusion of the Dawson Range Batholith, consisting of the regionally exposed Casino Granodiorite and the more localized Coffee Creek Granite. The Mount Nansen Volcanics, mainly andesite with a lesser felsic component, are possibly cogenetic with these intrusives.

Numerous intermediate to felsic porphyry stocks and dikes may be of Mount Nansen age in part, but they are at least in part younger. The Bow Creek Granite is a newly defined, high level, granophyric pluton with related, peripheral quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes. These rocks appear to cut the Mount Nansen volcanics and may be as young as the Carmacks volcanism. The Caribou Creek Conglomerate is a very localized sedimentary sequence which underlies the Carmacks volcanics.

The Carmacks Volcanic Suite, uppermost Cretaceous in age, is relatively flat-lying and has been subdivided into three units. The lowermost consists of felsic pyroclastic rocks and associated glassy domes or plugs. The middle unit, which appears to be quite thin in the map area, consists of andesite flows and pyroclastics with minor basalt. The most extensive is the upper unit, which consists mainly of basalt flows.

Mineral deposits are of four main types, including porphyries, veins, skarns and placer. Transitional varieties are associated with brecciation and porphyry dike emplacement. The porphyries are low grade copper-molybdenum deposits with local gold enrichment in the upper parts. Breccias with elevated precious metal values occur within the porphyries and also peripherally associated with quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes. Gold and silver-bearing quartz veins occur in dilational fracture systems which are also peripheral to the porphyries. In the presence of calcareous meta-sediments of Yukon Crystalline Terrane, gold-bearing, iron-rich skarns have formed. Base metal-rich veins are rare and distal from the porphyry centres.

Mineralization controls are recognised as follows::

1. Proximity to major regional structures such as the Big Creek Fault and the Minto Linear which extends north-northeasterly through the map area.

2. Local structures, ranging in trend from northwesterly to northeasterly, are important as hydrothermal channelways and vein sites.

3. Presence of a favourable host, including Mount Nansen volcanics, siliceous meta-sediments and Casino Granodiorite.

4. Proximity to porphyry stocks or quartz-feldspar pophyry dikes.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The eastern part of the area is underlain by Proterozoic to early Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks of Cassiar terrane, a fragment of the North American miogeocline which has been displaced northward on the Tintina-NRTM fault. The western part of the area is underlain by basaltic metavolcanics, serpentinized ultramafic rocks, metagabbro, and cherty and calcareous metasediments of the Slide Mountain terrane. Unfoliated to weakly foliated granitic intrusives (Marker Lake and Cassiar batholiths and Cabin Creek and Gravel Creek stocks) occur throughout the area intruding both the Cassiar and Slide Mountain terranes. Slide Mountain and Cassiar terranes are juxtaposed by an east-verging thrust referred to in this area as the Zak fault. Southwest of Irvine Lake, the thrust places serpentine, basaltic meta-volcanics, and an undeformed dioritic intrusion onto a footwall consisting of the Proterozoic Tsaydiz Formation and older units. Northwest of Irvine Lake, near Shootamook Creek, the thrust places cherty metasediments of the allochthon onto marble and quartzite inferred to be lower Cambrian Rosella and Boya Formations, respectively. The northern end of the Cassiar batholith extends into the southwestern corner of Irvine Lake map area. Its northeastern contact with rocks of Slide Mountain terrane is a subvertical, northwest-southeast trending mylonite zone several tens of metres wide. Mesoscopic structures including S-C fabrics and shear bands prove dextral displacement parallel to a variably plunging, but commonly sub-horizontal stretching lineation. The mylonite zone lies along a pronounced topographic lineamnet which extends from the trace of the Cassiar fault south of the Alaska Highway northwestwardly into the Irvine Lake map-area rather than veering to the west as previously mapped.
Mineral occurrences in this area are primarily near the contact of granitic intrusions and carbonate rocks.

Most of the area is in the Dawson Range subdivision of the Yukon Plateau in west-central Yukon Territory.

The oldest rocks in the region are metamorphosed Proterozoic to Paleozoic(?) sedimentary and igneous rocks of the Yukon Metamorphic Complex. They are intruded by batholiths and plutons of hornblende and (or) biotite granodiorite, monzonite, and quartz monzonite of three Mesozoic suites. The older two, which show penetrative metamorphic textures, are the Triassic(?) Klotassin Suite and the Jurassic(?) Big Creek Suite. The third is the unmetamorphosed Dawson Range Suite of Middle Cretaceous age. Slightly younger igneous units consist of felsic to intermediate volcanic and subvolcanic rocks of the Mount Nansen Suite. Early Tertiary igneous rocks include extrusive andesite, basalt, and minor rhyodacite of the Carmacks Suite, and the slightly younger monzonite to quartz monzonite of the Prospector Mountain Suite.

The district contains numerous mineral deposits and occurrences of economic interest. Copper and molybdenum deposits are associated with felsic plutons of at least two ages. Lode gold deposits and one gold-bismuth vein are associated with felsic volcanic rocks and associated subvolcanic intrusions of the Mount Nansen Suite. Placer gold deposits are derived from these rocks. Lead-zinc-silver veins are associated with late-stage intrusions of the Dawson Range and Prospector Mountain Suites. Skarn deposits occur in rocks of the Yukon Metamorphic Complex along borders of younger plutonic rocks.

42454,"information","Regeneration on Linear Developments Subject to Wildfires in a Zone of Continuous Permafrost.","With assistance from the Yukon Oil and Gas Branch, EDI Environmental Dynamics Inc. developed and submitted a proposal to the Mining and Petroleum Environmental Research Group (MPERG) to conduct a study of vegetation regeneration on linear developments subject to wildfires, specifically on and in the vicinity of the winter access road leading to test well site K- 58, beginning in the first post-fire growing season. The study site was located in sub-arctic, black spruce (Picea mariana) dominated forest in a zone of continuous permafrost in the area of Eagle Plains, YT.  The study examined vegetation composition and abundance, as well as soil and permafrost conditions, in four types of linear disturbances, including: 1) burned 30+ year old seismic lines;
2) a burned one-year-old winter road; 3) the same burned one-year-old winter road constructed on an existing, 30+ year old seismic line, and; 4) unburned 30+ year old seismic lines. A total of 73 (200m2) paired vegetation plots were completed within each of the above linear disturbances and adjacent forests.  Overall, the vegetation was highly uniform among all types of linear disturbances and undisturbed sites in the study area. Differences in species composition and abundance were most pronounced between the burned and unburned sites, with a greater number of species present and higher vegetation cover in unburned sites. Of the three types of linear disturbances sampled, the combined disturbance of the burned one year old winter road constructed on a 30+ year old seismic line demonstrated the most notable differences in vegetation composition and abundance in comparison with the adjacent forest. In contrast, species composition and abundance in the burned winter road and burned 30+ year old seismic line were more similar to that in adjacent, burned forests.
No trends in soil moisture were detected among the various disturbance types. Depth to permafrost was slightly lower in all three linear disturbances, but this difference was not significant. Depth of organic soil was significantly lower in the combined disturbance of the burned one year old winter road constructed on a 30+ year old seismic line, and was significantly higher in the burned winter road, when compared to adjacent, burned forests. Moss depth was significantly higher in unburned than burned sites.
In the first post-fire year, this recent burn appears to be the dominant factor affecting vegetation composition and abundance in the study area. Re-vegetation is occurring rapidly on linear disturbances, with the dominant vascular plant species in the unburned, undisturbed forest regenerating across all disturbance types. Because the study was completed in the first post-fire growing season, it was not possible to assess regeneration of black spruce, an important structural species that is not reported to begin to regenerate until several years after a burn. Similarly, it was also not possible to assess lichen re-establishment, an important element of vegetation succession in black spruce forest that also re-establishes later than the first post-fire
growing season. Continued monitoring will be required to understand the longer term response of vegetation to fire in linear disturbances.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42455,"information","Sedimentology of White Channel Placer Deposits, Klondike, West Central Yukon","The White Channel placer deposit in the Klondike area is a Pliocene to early Pleistocene braid plain sequence with tributary alluvial fan and gravity flow deposits.

Lithofacies types range from laminated silt and clay to massive and disorganized boulder gravel. A total of 14 lithofacies types have been identified with cryogenic features such as ice wedge casts found in the upper half of the White Channel section. Dominant lithofacies types include distinctly stratified and crudely stratified gravel which is clast-supported and matrix-filled. An alteration product is recognizable in both White Channel sediments and underlying bedrock.

Proximal White Channel sedimentation is characterized by interbedded channel sequences deposited under fluctuating, high discharge and flood conditions. Medial to distal positions are dominantly sequences of low relief unit barforms and channel lag deposits. Sorting and stratification improves up-section, and facies trends are not consistent. Deposition of White Channel sediments in valley margin positions is characterized by gravelly mass flows which are interbedded with stratified fluvial sediments.

Placer gold is found in all of the White Channel gravelly facies sampled. Concentration of gold in proximal gravelly facies is due to the development of convergent flow in shallow channels during peak discharge intervals. In medial to distal positions, heavy minerals are concentrated in channel sluiceways and aggraded unit bars. Convergent flow in sluiceways between unit bars is not as susceptible to fluctuating discharge levels, and as a result, sorting and concentration mechanisms are more efficient up-section. Gold is also concentrated in gravelly mass flow deposits through shear and suspension sorting.

Two bodies (Bennett Creek pluton and an unnamed body west of Tungsten) give ages of ~91 Ma and are correlated with the Tombstone Plutonic Suite. Two phases of the Coal River batholith give ages of ~96 Ma and are considered to be part of the Tay River plutonic suite. Finally, the Mt.

A new research project has been initiated that will examine the temporal, geochemical and petrotectonic evolution of this magmatic event, and the nature and origin of associated Cu, Au and PGE mineralization. The intrusions are mainly hornblende- and biotite-bearing granodiorites and quartz monzonites, although granitic phases and rare ultramafic phases (as at Pyroxene Mountain) are also present. Several bodies of coarse-grained muscovite granite that are included within the suite have been recognized in southwestern Dawson, and central and western Stewart River map areas. Most intrusions give preliminary U-Pb zircon and titanite ages of ~195 Ma to ~185 Ma, although scattered bodies give ages up to 218 Ma. Geochemical studies completed thus far indicate that most intrusions are metaluminous and formed in a volcanic arc environment, although some of the muscovite-granite phases in western Yukon are peraluminous and trend into the anorogenic (within-plate) granite field on various tectonic discriminant plots. Dating studies at Minto and Williams Creek indicate that copper-gold mineralization in both areas is hosted in part by deformed intrusions dated at ~194 Ma and is crosscut by massive, post-mineralization Granite Mountain batholith dated at ~190 Ma. The mineralization is therefore intimately associated with the Triassic-Jurassic magmatism, and we tentatively interpret the deposits as deformed copper-gold porphyries.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Regional Geology,igneous petrology","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Chemical analyses indicate that most of the volcanic rocks of the Seagull Creek volcanic belt are alkali rich and potassic.

Silver, lead and zinc in the form of argentiferous galena and sphalerite and barium in barite constitute most of the mineralization associated with the volcanic rocks. Two main styles of mineralization occur:: stratabound-tpe and vein-type.

A model of origin for the deposit is speculative, but at this preliminary stage, two classes of stratiform mineralization are proposed for this area, both related to exhalative centres. The first type is local (proximal) and consists of more massive and thicker layered sulphide units interbedded with the regional clastic and exhalite horizons.

42474,"information","Distribution of Miles Canyon basalt in the Whitehorse area and implications for groundwater resources","Miocene Miles Canyon basalts play a critical role in the historical development and modern economics of the City of Whitehorse. Where cut by the Yukon River, the unnavigable waters at Miles Canyon and the Whitehorse Rapids formed a natural terminus that became a transportation hub that in turn encouraged settlement. Today, this basalt is responsible not only for efficient and economical hydroelectric power, but also for hosting the groundwater resources for many of Whitehorse's rural residents. Much of the city is underlain by Cretaceous granodiorite of the Whitehorse Batholith, which is a relatively poor aquifer due to its lack of porosity. Miles Canyon basalt however, has significantly higher innate hydraulic permeability and thus provides better opportunities for additional groundwater resources and aquifer development. Miles Canyon basalts have reported hydraulic conductivity values around 2 x 10^-6 m/s, which are 20 to 50 times higher than reported hydraulic conductivity values for unfractured granodiorite aquifers. As such, the loci of basalt limits have important implications for the siting of productive private water wells.

This paper summarizes details of Miles Canyon basalt occurrences within the limits of the City of Whitehorse and provides updated mapping of the extent and distribution of the basalt within the City. The discussion includes a summary of six outcrop observations, twelve water-well record data, a shallow reflected seismic survey and interpretation of regional aeromagnetic data related to basalt distribution. Thickness of Miles Canyon basalt intersected in drill holes ranges from as little as 1.8 m up to 110 m, although most drill holes did not penetrate the total basalt thickness.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,bedrock mapping,water-well data","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The BPP is characterized by fresh spinel peridotite. Plagioclase mantles on spinel grains are interpreted to have developed during decompressive metamorphism during exhumation from sub-crustal depths to mid- to upper-crustal depths. The peridotite body forms a foliaform lens 580 m by 100 m that is enclosed in and intruded by leucocratic, biotite-garnet-corundum blue orthogneiss.The peridotite and blue corundum orthogneiss are in turn hosted in a north-dipping panel of amphibolite-grade metamorphic rocks that are included in the pericratonic Devono-Mississippian Wolverine Creek metamorphic suite, part of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane.

Leucocratic tonalite gneiss, part of the ~357 Ma Selwyn Gneiss, occurs north of, and structurally above the BPP. Tonalite veins intrude the blue corundum orthogneiss and are interpreted as marginal intrusions of the Selwyn orthogneiss.

The Laberge Group is divisible into the following informal units: the Richthofen, Nordenskiöld, Conglomerate, and Tanglefoot formations. The Tanglefoot, which comprises a large portion of the exposed strata at Division Mountain, is here subdivided into the lower and upper members. The lower member consists of quartz-rich sandstone, grit, polymicitic conglomerate and laminated siltstone. The upper member is coal-bearing and typified by white grit, sandstone, and carbonaceous shale. The overlying Tantalus Formation is characterized by thick packages of resistant chert pebble conglomerate with intercalated sandstone beds, which form local highlands at Cub, Corduroy, Division, and Vowel mountains.

The strata at Division Mountain are folded into several upright, tight northwest-trending anticlines and synclines with
amplitudes of 2 to 7 km. The folded strata are intruded by feldspar-hornblende andesite sills and dykes.

Organic matter identified within coal and siltstone of the Tanglefoot and Tantalus formations consists of Type III and
subordinate Type I kerogen, suggesting the material is largely gas-prone. A combination of thermal maturation indicators (vitrinite reflectance and Tmax ) suggests that the coal and related strata are in the early to late stages of thermal diagenesis. Samples of the underlying Richthofen formation contain Type III kerogen matured beyond the oil window.

As in Grass Lakes map area, chloritic schist and associated mafic and ultramafic meta-intrusive rocks in the Fire Lake area overlie a regionally persistent quartz-rich metaclastic and carbonate unit and underlie a thick carbonaceous phyllite unit with lesser marble and felsic meta-volcanic rocks.

Yukon-Tanana Terrane rocks are truncated to the east by a shear zone of mylonitic Mississippian granite that lies at the base of the Money Klippe. The klippe is composed of undeformed (except in the shear zone) Mississippian granite and granodiorite of the Simpson Range Plutonic Suite and their wall rocks and roof pendants. Wall rocks and pendants include meta-sedimentary, meta-volcanic and meta-intrusive rocks. Layered wall rocks include a lower quartz-rich metaclastic and carbonate unit and a chlorite-actinolite-epidote phyllite unit with mafic breccia, ?augite porphyry, bands of green chert, and variably thick and laterally persistent accumulations of white marble. Rocks of intrusive protolith include ca. 361 Ma quartz porphyry, gabbro and ultramafic rock. Most contacts are observed or inferred to be intrusive or stratigraphic and are not everywhere faulted as previously mapped. With the exception of the chert and marble in the mafic phyllite, the wall rocks bear a strong resemblance to Yukon-Tanana Terrane rocks beneath the shear zone and are tentatively correlated with them. Indeed, as the wall rock sequence is intruded by granite and granodiorite of the Simpson Range Plutonic Suite, a fundamental component of Yukon-Tanana Terrane, such a correlation seems required. Such a correlation would suggest that the basal shear zone of the klippe is a minor intra-terrane structure and not a major structure or terrane boundary as previously inferred.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Regional Geology,stratigraphic correlations","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The deposit is hosted by Devonian (?) and Mississippian rocks of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane and occurs close to the contact between chlorite schist and overlying carbonaceous phyllite. Copper-cobalt-gold mineralization occurs in two parallel zones: West Kona and East Kona.

The chemical composition and rare earth element (REE) pattern of chlorite schist which hosts the Kona zones is unique in the Fire Lake area. The data indicate that the protolith of these meta-volcanic rocks has a boninitic affinity and was likely derived from a depleted source region. Mafic meta-volcanic rocks (chlorite schist) elsewhere in this area are tholeiitic and may have developed in an arc or rift-related setting. Analyses of psammitic schists in the hanging wall of the West Kona zone indicate the rocks are felsic in composition and were likely deposited in a mature arc or continental-margin setting.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Fire Lake,VMS,Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide,igneous petrology","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The contact is superbly exposed on the west flank of Brute Mountain, south-central Yukon. This succession of Pliensbachian marine shales, sandstones and conglomerates records submarine gully and slope apron progradation. Distal prodelta shales and sandstones, conglomeratic chute-gully fill sequences, slope shales and slope conglomerates were deposited from the Middle Pliensbachian to the Early Toarcian.

Submarine chutes fed coarse clastic detritus past the shelf-break and across the slope. Ponding of coarse-grained mass flows built an onlap wedge against the slope, followed by deposition of mud turbidites and pelagic sediments. A rise in relative sea level continued during the deposition of the entire succession, suggesting the intercalated sequence formed as a result of variations in the rate of clastic input. The Brute Mountain succession is entirely of deep marine origin, typical of Laberge Group exposures elsewhere in the Whitehorse Trough.

Collision between the allochthonous Lewes River Arc and the cratonic margin of North America occurred during the Late Triassic. The final stages of convergence led to closure of the Whitehorse Trough seaway in the Middle Jurassic. Laberge Group strata record this closure. Brute Mountain exposures of late Early Jurassic age indicate that deep basin conditions existed at least into the Toarcian. Slope turbidite and pelagic sedimentary rocks place additional constraints on the timing of arc-continent collision. Significant shoaling of the Whitehorse Trough seaway apparently did not occur until after deposition of the Brute Mountain sequences.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Sag ponds and fresh fault scarps in glacial drift along these lineaments attest to relatively recent fault activity. NE-SW trending first and second order lineaments that cut obliquely across the Trench are considered to be late faults and fracture zones which formed after major strike-slip displacement on the TFZ.

42489,"information","A short history of the finding of gold in the Klondike","Gold was first reported in the Yukon region by fur traders and missionaries in the mid 1800s. Fur trader Robert Campbell noted the presence of gold near the site of Fort Selkirk in the early 1850s but neither missionaries nor fur traders were interested in gold. Nevertheless, miners drifted into the region. Economic depression pushed some prospectors northward. In 1880, the first miners were allowed to travel through one of the less important Tlingit trade routes, the Chilkoot Trail.

Gold was discovered In 1896 which led to a staking rush and an influx of prospectors the following summer. Construction and staking resulted in the occupation of the land of the Han First Nation people. The Han were removed to the Moosehide reserve, five kilometres down river from Dawson where they became legal charges of the Federal Department of Indian Affairs.

The growth of mining in the Klondike was supported by an expansion of commercial supply services. The Canadian government's maintenance of administrative powers and the dispatch of Mounties into the Klondike fulfilled the conditions for secure commercial capital investment. Increased flow of capital into the Klondike led to improvements in the transportation system supporting the region.

However, by 1902 gold production had started to slide. Old labour intensive mining methods were replaced by attempts to mechanize. By 1905 there were several steam shovels operating on different claims. However, the approach to mining still was still a fragmented one. Without comprehensive knowledge about the character of the resource, the major development strategy was one founded on luck. Effective mining demanded an integrated scientific approach using the most appropriate tools of modern technology. A radical change in resource development of the Klondike was in the making.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Production rates have varied since the mill start-up but the carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant is currently operating near capacity at 700 metric tonnes per day.

Mining at the Brown-McDade open pit has exposed two separate and distinct deposit types. The first type is gold-silver vein mineralization hosted by a massive feldspar porphyry dyke. These fine-grained quartz-sulphide veins and vein breccia are enclosed by silicified and/or intensely clay-altered brecciated feldspar porphyry. The feldspar porphyry dyke has intruded along an igneous-metamorphic contact that has been mined over a strike length of 50 m in the southern portion of the pit. The second deposit type that occurs at the north end of the pit consists of a siliceous, sulphide-rich breccia in a pipe-like structure hosted by metamorphosed carbonate and clastic rocks of the Nasina Assemblage. The pipe is elongate in plan with a high-grade core approximately 15 m wide and 25 m long surrounded by a low-grade envelope consisting of quartz-sulphide stringers in a silicified breccia. The deposits are separated by a northeast-striking fault which truncates and offsets the main vein-dyke mineralization.

The ore is composed of fine-grained quartz and sulphides in narrow veins or as matrix to a breccia of silicified and pyritized wall rock fragments. Unoxidized ore contains dark grey silica and pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, galena, sulphosalts, bornite, stibnite and chalcopyrite. Gold is genetically related to the pyrite phase of the mineralization and occurs as 5 to 50 micron-sized inclusions in pyrite grains. Oxidation of sulphide minerals extends to depths of up to 70 m and a large portion of the gold grains have been exposed by oxidation of the sulphides and post-depositional cataclastic fractures in the pyrite. The silver mineralogy is not as well understood but appears to be related to the base metal sulphide mineralization.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,deposit models","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Basalt formerly thought Quaternary is also of Eocene age. The concordance of dates between the mafic and felsic volcanics indicates a single Paleogene bimodal volcanic province. Such bimodal suites are commonly linked to crustal extension and normal faulting, which in this case are presumably related to transcurrent slip along Tintina Fault.

The connection between Paleogene volcanism and the geographical extent of placer gold in this area is more than circumstantial.

To test the effectiveness of this technique in the exploration for VMS deposits two areas of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane were chosen for study:: Matson Creek and Bradens Canyon. At Matson Creek, a biogeochemical signature was obtained from a site with known polymetallic sulphides and data compared with known soil geochemistry. At Bradens Canyon soil and biogeochemical samples were collected. At each sample site in the two locations twigs were collected from both black and white spruce trees according to availability, along several transects. Results indicate that biogeochemical sampling is a viable alternative to soil sampling. The data show that the two species of spruce contain different concentrations of elements, therefore care must be taken during the sampling procedure to identify which species is being sampled.

Extended bioleaching (to a 6-day retention time) appeared to result in losses of gold and silver to the bioleachate solution which in turn led to poorer cyanide extraction efficiencies.

Flotation testing of the Rainbow zone composite provided for this test program indicates that flotation recoveries of 92% for gold and 88% for silver should be achievable, into a flotation concentrate assaying 40 to 45 g Au/tonne and 4,000 to 5,000 g Ag/tonne, depending on the head grade of the material being processed.

Achievable cyanide extractions on washed bioleach residue appear to be 92% for gold and 88% for silver. These extraction values will need to be confirmed in the second phase of work planned for this test program. Suitable cyanidation conditions appear to be a 36 to 48-hour leach retention time on washed bioleach residue, pH 10 to 10.5, a target cyanide concentration of 1 g NaCN/L, and reagent consumptions of 10 to 15 kg NaCN/tonne and 35 to 45 kg Ca(OH)2/tonne of cyanidation feed.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The outcrops of the Amphitheatre Formation can be divided into two discrete basins:: the northern Burwash basin and the southern Bates Lake basin.

Sedimentological analysis of the Burwash basin identified fault-controlled depocentres which allowed the development of several different types of non-marine depositional environments in close proximity. Palynology and organic petrology data indicate that the Amphitheatre Formation is diachronous and spans the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.

Light-mineral provenance studies of sandstones, clast-counts in conglomerates and paleocurrent analyses suggest that the Wrangellia and Yukon Crystalline Terranes were sources for the Amphitheatre Formation in the Burwash basin. In contrast, preliminary work suggests that Wrangellia and possibly the Gravina-Nutzotin Terrane may have been important sources for the Amphitheatre Formation in the Bates Lake basin.

Structural data combined with geologic mapping indicate a predominance of strike-slip deformation during and after deposition of the Amphitheatre Formation in the Burwash basin. The presence of syndepositional faults with subhoriziontal slickenside indicates that strike-slip deformation occurred during deposition of the Amphitheatre sediments. The Burwash basin contains structures indicative of both contractional and strike-slip deformation, whereas the Bates Lake basin contains structures indicative of both extensional and strike-slip deformation. The change in structural style between the two basins suggests that the Amphitheatre Formation may have been deposited in transpressional as well as transtensional tectonic settings along individual segments of the Denali fault system during the middle Cenozoic.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42512,"information","Cyanide - The Facts","Cyanide is probably one of the most universally recognized poisons. Cyanide contains a carbon atom connected to a nitrogen atom, hence the chemical formula CN. However, the term cyanide is used to refer to a wide array of chemicals containing cyanide. Cyanides can be manufactured (from ammonia and natural gas, or as a by-product of acrylic fibres and plastics production) but they also occur in nature.

Due to its toxic nature, cyanide has been used as a fumigant and poison since early time, however, its most familiar use in the Yukon is in the mining industry. Over 90% of the gold mined in Canada is extracted using a cyanidation process. Cyanide forms a very stable complex with several metals and has been used since 1887 to extract gold, silver, copper, zinc and molybdenum from ores.

Waste cyanide in tailings ponds and abandoned heap leach pads can be dealt with in several ways: natural degradation or attenuation, chemical degradation, hydrogen peroxide process, alkaline chlorination, sulphur dioxide-air oxidation, or microbial processes.

Long term adverse effects associated with mining sites are related primarily to metals rather than cyanide. Cyanide can naturally degrade rapidly in the environment by volatilizing to hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN). This gas is dangerous in a closed system but much less so when gradually released in an out-of-doors environment.

The toxicity of cyanide is very dependent on its form. Mine effluents, tailings and leach pond water can contain cyanide in many forms ranging from the cyanide ion to strong metal cyanide complexes. The toxicity of cyanide compounds depends on the compound's ability to release the cyanide.

Each mine in the Yukon must abide by a Water Licence issued by the Yukon Territory Water Board. The licence ha standards of cyanide concentration that must be met in the effluent before it is discharged to the receiving environment.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Rocks of the Sloko volcanic province are preserved as downfaulted blocks and as erosional remnants on higher upland surfaces. They comprise an assemblage of intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks and derived sedimentary rocks that lie unconformably on Cretaceous granitic rocks, folded Jurassic rocks and Precambrian (?) metasedimentary rocks.

The MSVC is Paleocene-Eocene in age, and elliptical in plan; it covers an area of about 140 km squared. It is a downfaulted volcanic block, deposited on Cretaceous granitic rocks of the Ruby Range Batholith  and older metasedimentary rocks of the Yukon Group.  The complex is surrounded peripherally by several high-level rhyolite intrusions which have recently been dated at 53 ±1.1 Ma using rubidium-strontium geochronology.

The MSVC has a maximum vertical thickness of 850 m. It includes:: 1) a downfaulted part of an andesitic stratovolcano which forms the western and southern parts of the complex and comprises the distal and medial facies assemblage of Formations 1 and 2, and the more proximal facies assemblage of Formation 3 a small felsic cauldron subsidence structure in the northeast corner of the area represented by the felsic cauldron-fill deposits of Formation 4; 3) an andesitic vent facies environment located in a small area in the midwestern part of the complex and comprising the deposits of Formation 5; and 4) a central quartz-feldspar-phyric rhyolite intrusion along the western boundary of the small felsic cauldron.

A NNE-trending fracture system is the dominant and perhaps the latest structural feature in the MSVC. Economic epigenetic gold veins are found in three major subparallel NNE-trending fault zones. The veins consist of quartz and calcite and are unusual in that they contain no sulphides and have poorly developed wall rock alteration. As of February 1984, the average grade was 27 g/t gold and 22.63 g/t silver with proven reserves of 149,114 tonnes.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Significant mineralization of Cu, U, Co, Ag and Au within and near breccia zones occurred during widespread Fe, CO2, and Si metasomatism. Following a period of hydrothermal activity and intense fracturing, breccia zones in the study area were generated in open spaces produced by extensional faulting or rapid expansion of volatile-rich fluids. A strong spatial correlation between breccia and crosscutting mafic to felsic intrusions indicates a magmatic linkage. Metasomatism extended from before brecciation to after cooling of the igneous intrusions. The metasomatising fluids may have been partly derived from residual liquids of possible tholeiitic magma chambers fractionating at depth. Regional deformation and metamorphism incurred during Racklan orogeny in Middle Proterozoic time preceded brecciation; the breccias developed in fully lithified rock.

Differential uplift and faster erosion on the west side of the fault between the mid-Cretaceous and Early Paleocene could account for this difference in cooling history. This fault forms the approximate western edge of the Whitehorse Trough, and is marked by a dramatic change in the isopach of Jurassic and Triassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks which form a thin veneer over rocks of the Coast Plutonic Complex on the west side, and a very thick sedimentary sequence on the east side where basement rocks are not seen.

Skukum Volcanic Complex. Reconnaissance investigations showed that the TM imagery was valuable for detecting and mapping small scale geological lineaments and for recognizing limonitic rocks. The imagery, however, was not useful for identifying or differentiating lithologic units. A further limitation of the imagery was the loss of information in the shadows created by the extreme topography of the region and the low sun angle present at the time of image acquisition. Detailed field investigations conducted on the Mt.

Three unmapped and potentially significant lineaments were mapped using the TM imagery. These new lineaments (Vesuvius-Chieftain Hill, Sulphide Creek, and Rhyolite Creek) are probably deep-seated fractures. Alteration zones, primarily iron oxide rich rocks, were also mapped successfully. Attempts at identifying hydrothermally altered rocks failed.

Subvolcanic porphyritic intrusions within the Wolverine deposit are located approximately 10-20 m beneath exhalative sulphide bodies or iron-formation in four zones (Wolverine/Lynx, Fisher, Sable and Puck). Most intrusions are K-feldspar porphyritic (Fisher and Wolverine/Lynx Zones); however, a few are quartz and K-feldspar porphyritic (Puck and Sable zones).
Feldspar-porphyritic intrusions consist of euhedral to subhedral grains of K-feldspar in a grey fine-grained matrix. Quartz-feldspar porphyritic intrusions contain slightly smaller feldspar crystals and blue to black glassy quartz eyes set in a fine-grained matrix. Most of the intrusions have non-peperitic upper margins with carbonaceous argillite (Wolverine/Lynx, Fisher, Puck). Some of the quartz- feldspar porphyritic intrusions are in contact with fine-grained volcaniclastic rocks along their upper margins (Sable); both types of intrusions have lower contacts with fine-grained volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks. These intrusions are, for the most part, unaltered and have only minor sericite-silica ±chlorite ±pyrite alteration and small mm-to cm-scale veinlets of quartz-sericite ±chlorite ±pyrite ± sphalerite. This suggests a pre-to syn-mineralization timing for the emplacement of the intrusions. The contribution of these intrusions to the heat and metal budget of the Wolverine deposit is the focus of ongoing research.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,deposit models,igneous petrology","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Weathering has in many cases removed all obvious signs of mineralization and has resulted in the dispersion of soluble metals in the near surface. For these reasons, exploration based on traditional prospecting methods and soil geochemical surveys has met with limited success. Geological mapping is hindered by the lack of exposure and by the complex geology. To address these problems a detailed airborne geological sruvery, combining gamma ray spectrometric, magnetic and VLF sesors, was flown in the Dawson Range, central Yukon Tanana Terrane. Spectrometric data were used to determine the average surface concentration of potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th). Lithological units are characterized by relatively consistent geochemical signatures permitting improved geological mapping based on the distribution of spectrometric domains.

Geological mapping at
1::50 000 scale in a well exposed area of the Campbell Range, southeastern Yukon, was undertaken to examine the kinematics of the Finlayson Lake fault zone and rock types of the Slide Mountain terrane.

Five units were identified: (1) chloritic schist and phyllite, (2) laminated metachert and carbonaceous black slate, (3) tan weathering metachert and maroon siliceous and argillaceous metasiltstone, (4) greenstone and associated breccia, gabbro, metagreywacke, metachert and maroon metasiltstone and (5) serpentinite. Unit 2 is structurally interleaved with submap-scale bodies or layers of serpentinite, hornblende-plagioclase porphyry, plagioclase-potassium fledspar porphyry, quartz-eye muscovite-chlorite phyllite or schist, chloritic schist and minor grey, calcareous metacarbonate. Serpentinite is also exposed in unit 4 and as small slivers along the thrust contact between units 3 and 4.

Lithologically, units 4 and 5 are similar to the upper division of the Slide Mountain terrane in east-central and north-central British Columbia. Unit 2 has similarities with the lowest division of the Sylvester allochthon and is tentatively correlated with the Slide Mountain terrane. Maroon metasiltstone in unit 3 is indistinguishable lithologically from metasiltstone in the overlying greenstone unit suggesting that the eastern thrust fault juxxtaposes parts of the same depositional sequence, ie. The Slide Mountain terrane. Regional correlation of unit 1 is unclear.

Unit 2 is inferred to be bounded to the east and west by northwest-striking faults and to the south, by an east-striking, steeply dipping, normal (north-side down) fault. The northern boundary of unit 2 is unconstrained. Greenstone (unit 4) is thrust towards the southwest over unit 1 in the western part of the map area along a northwest-striking, gently northeast-dipping thrust fault. In the eastern part of the map area, greenstone is thrust towards the northeast over unit 3 along a northwest-striking, moderately southwest-dipping thrust fault. Outcrop data and topographic patterns suggest that the eastern thrust fault is truncated by a northwest-striking, steeply dipping fault and that the normal fault truncates the westernmost northwest-striking fault. The northwest-striking faults are poorly exposed and their kinematics have yet to be determined. However, if they are steep faults, they are likely dextral strike-slip faults.

Field data indicate that the Finlayson Lake fault zone consists of diverging thrust faults and subparallel strike-slip(?) faults. These structures are consistent with the interpretation of the Finlayson Lake fault zone as a transpressive fault zone.

Low grade porphyry-style copper mineralization was discovered on the property in 1969. The main country rock in the study area is a potassium feldspar megacrystic granite that is correlated with the Early Jurassic Aishihik and/or Long Lake plutonic suite. Mineralization on the property is hosted by a multiphase intrusive complex that is thought to represent a high level intrusive member of the Late Cretaceous Mount Creedon volcanic suite. The complex consists of three distinct phases, medium-grained diorite; coarse-grained diorite; and porphyritic quartz monzodiorite. U-Pb zircon dating of the medium-grained diorite and porphyritic quartz monzodiorite phases gives ages of 78.2 ± 0.1 Ma and 78.8 ± 0.2 Ma, respectively, which supports the correlation with the Mount Creedon Volcanic Suite.

Four alteration zones are recognized on the property. Alteration is mainly developed in the medium-grained diorite and quartz monzodiorite phases. In order of decreasing intensity, these zones include potassic, phyllic, albitic, and propylitic. Copper mineralization consists of chalcopyrite, which occurs as a replacement of earlier-formed magnetite in the potassic and phyllic zones, and malachite which occurs on weathered fracture surfaces.

Alteration and mineralization on the property are thought to be related either to fluids evolved during the latest stages of crystallization of the main phase diorite unit or from a buried, younger phase of the intrusive complex.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The onset of McConnell glaciation was marked by an early ice advance out of the Lapie River valley, which was followed by a general ice flow toward the west or northwest along the Tintina Trench. During the retreat of the McConnell glacier, an ice tongue advanced up the Lapie River valley, blocking the drainage and forming a glacial lake.

42552,"information","Geology, mineralogy and geochemistry of tin and tungsten veins, breccias and skarns, Mcquesten River Region (115 P (north) and 105 M/13), Yukon","Tin and tungsten-bearing veins, breccias and skarns occur in a 60 km long belt trending west from Keno Hill to the Tintina Fault. They are hosted by mid-Cretaceous felsic intrusions, or adjacent metasedimentary rocks of Upper Precambrian to Mississippian age. Tin occurrences are mainly associated with two-mica granites in the southern part of the belt, while the tungsten lodes are more commonly associated with biotite-hornblende granitoids. Tin- and silver-bearing veins are associated with the central granite phase of a zoned intrusion in the northwest part of the belt (the Syenite Range). The zoned intrusion ranges in composition from tourmaline orbicular granite to granite to quartz monzonite to syenite.

Most skarns are tungsten-dominant, whereas most breccias and veins are tin-bearing. The skarns are calcic and reduced. Three stages of skarn mineral formation and associated minerals are recognized:: 1) isochemical contact metamorphism, including diopside, grossular, wollastonite, and tremolite; 2) metasomatic skarn formation including andradite, idocrase, hedenbergite, axinite, and some sulphide minerals; and 3) retrograde alteration including actinolite, chlorite, clinozoisite, epidote, calcite, biotite, scheelite, cassiterite and sulphide minerals. Sulphide minerals are mostly minor, with pyrrhotite and pyrite predominant.

Breccias, veins and sheeted veins of tin and tungsten occur in steeply diping tabular bodies close to felsic intrusions. The veins consist of quartz, tourmaline or chlorite. Tin-bearing veins and breccias contain all three gangue minerals plus pyrrhotite, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and galena. Tungsten is only found in quartz (~orthoclase) veins which contain minor pyrite and molybdenite.

Sheeted vein systems consist of three mineral assemblages:: 1)quartz-orthoclase-scheelite, 2) quartz-orthoclase-cassiterite, and 3) tourmaline-cassiterite. The first assemblage is present both in the endo- and exocontact of felsic intrusions, whereas the second and third occur further away from the granite in metasedimentary rocks which generally lie outside the thermal aureole of the intrusion.

Breccia clasts consist of quartzite, schist, and/or vein fragments (quartz, tourmaline, or chlorite). The breccias are either clast-supported with a matrix of rock flour, or matrix-supported with a matrix (groundmass) of crystalline quartz, tourmaline or chlorite similar to vein material.

Geochemical studies of the McQuesten River occurrences indicate that:: 1) Some properties are exclusively tin or tungsten properties, but others contain both metals. There is a positive correlation between tungsten and tin in some tin-bearing rocks. 2) Silver is common in veins and skarns which contain over 50 ppm Sn. 3) Gold occurs in significant quantities in most skarns and in several veins. 4) There is a positive correlation between gold and bismuth in the skarns. Bismuth can be used as a pathfinder for gold in these skarns.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42553,"information","Geology and alteration of the Grew Creek epithermal gold-silver prospect, south-central Yukon","Grew Creek epithermal gold prospect, in south-central Yukon Territory, is adjacent to and southwest of the Robert Campbell Highway, halfway between the communities of Ross River and Faro. The prospect is within the Tintina Trench, which from Late Cretaceous to Tertiary time was a zone of major right lateral movement that juxtaposed the Cambrian and Ordovician slate and phyllites of the Pelly-Cassiar Platform (to the southwest) against rocks of the Anvil Allochthon (to the northeast).

Grew Creek rocks are mid-Eocene based on K-Ar dates of basalt of 51.4 ±1.8 Ma and 50.7 ±1.8 Ma and pollen spores in volcaniclastic rock dated at 56 to 46 Ma. Felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks were overlain by a sequence of interbedded coarse clastic sediments, basaltic flows, and basaltic volcaniclastic rock. Late Tertiary uplift and faulting resulted in graben formation and consequent preservation of Eocene rocks in a structurally complex graben bounded to the south by the Grew Creek fault and to the north by the Danger Creek fault.

Mineralization at Grew Creek occurs at the tip of a westwardly pointing wedge of dominantly felsic, crystal lithic lapilli tuff. The zone of precious metal deposition is truncated to the northeast by steeply dipping clastic sediments and to the southwest by the Grew Creek Fault. Gold, electrum, pyrite, and silver selenide were identified in a high grade sample from the discovery outcrop.

Alteration at Grew Creek is both surficial and hydrothermal. Surficial alteration is ubiquitous, pervasive, and characterized by mixed-layer clays and carbonates. Hydrothermal alteration, responsible for the gold-silver mineralization is closely associated with rhyolitic dykes and is of three types:: silicic, acid sulphate, and argillic acid sulphate. K-Ar dating of sericite indicates hydrothermal alteration is mid-Eocene (51.5 ±1.8 Ma and 47.0 ±1.7 Ma) and synchronous with deposition of the volcanics.

Quartz associated with mineralization at Grew Creek is enriched in heavy oxygen isotopes. A deep magmatic source for the mineralized fluids is one explanation for this enrichment.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The lodes are the source for more than 120,000 ounces of downstream placer gold production. These lodes contain variable amounts pyrrhotite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite, with less abundant scheelite - alkali-feldspar, muscovite, biotite and tourmaline are common gangue phases. Grab samples of mineralization often contain gold grades in excess of 1 ounce per ton. Gold-to-silver ratios vary most commonly from 1:1 to 5:1. Gold-rich quartz veins cut all stocks, adjacent hornfels and associated lamprophyre dykes commonly contain greater than 1% arsenic. Bismuth, and less consistently tungsten and stibnite, characterize many of the most highly mineralized veins within and surrounding the stocks. Quartz veins along the intrusive-metasedimentary rock contact around the Pukelman stock are also enriched in lead and silver.

R-mode factor analysis of multi-element geochemical data for 111 gold- and sulphide-bearing rock samples indicates that there are two geochemically distinct metal suites in the Clear Creek occurrences. The first is characterized by As-Au-Bi ± Sb, Te ore-related mineral association, which is typical of many intrusion-related deposits in the Tombstone gold belt. Less consistently, anomalous concentrations of Ag, Co, Cu, Fe, and Mo occur within these auriferous rocks. The second metal factor is defined by Ag-Bi-Pb ± As, Au and Te.

42556,"information","Geology and Geochemistry of the Teslin Crossing Pluton: A gold-rich alkalic porphyry target","The Teslin Crossing Pluton is a small (~75 km2), elliptical body which intrudes Jurassic Whitehorse Trough strata of Stikine Terrane. The pluton consists of a border phase, a lithologically and texturally complex central phase, and associated sills and dyke swarms. The border phase consists of a grey, crowded hornblende-plagioclase porphyry. The central phase consists of pink, medium to coarse grained, equigranular monzonite and syenite. Pyroxene and hornblende are essential constituents. Abundant accessory minerals include magnetite (up to 5%), titanite, apatite, rutile and zircon. Modal quartz is absent. Dykes and sills have compositions similar to the border phase. All phases contain a large amount of pea- to cobble-sized xenoliths including coarse-grained pyroxenite, coarse-grained gabbro and fine-grained diorite. The border phase also include sedimentary xenoliths. Locally there are zones of brecciation and potassic alteration.

Geochemically the pluton is alkalic with 3.1-3.4% K2O, 60-68% SiO2 and minor normative quartz. Most rocks are metaluminous but more evolved phases are slightly peraluminous. The pluton is classified as a slightly silica-saturated, pyroxenite-associated syenite. New and existing collections of macrofossils from the sedimentary rocks adjacent to the pluton indicate an age range of Pliensbachian to Aalenian, and provide a maximum age constraint for the pluton. A preliminary U-Pb date from the sill complex yields an age of approximately 175 Ma which is younger than the K-Ar ages of 181-186 Ma from the pluton. The Teslin Crossing pluton is an Early Jurassic alkalic plutonic complex in Stikine Terrane, and as such, is an excellent target for gold-rich porphyry copper mineralization.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

This stock and associated dykes and sills intrude highly deformed metasedimentary strata of the Yusezyu Formation of the Neoproterozoic to Lower Cambrian Hyland Group. The emplacement of TPS intrusions post-dates regional greenschist-facies metamorphism and multiple phases of ductile deformation related to the Tombstone strain zone. Although the Scheelite Dome stock hosts auriferous, sheeted quartz veins, extensive soil geochemistry indicates that the bulk of the gold resource is hosted in the variably hornfelsed metasedimentary rocks immediately south of the stock. The associated gold-in-soil anomaly forms an east-trending corridor of anomalous gold values (>80 ppb) approximately 6 km long by 1.5 km wide, with a more weakly defined eastern continuation. Where metasedimentary bedrock is exposed in the corridor, gold is hosted in fault-vein arrays, and less commonly as disseminated grains and in replacement zones. The styles and distribution of mineralization are largely controlled by brittle structures; a phase of east-west shortening was largely coeval with gold mineralization.

R-mode factor analysis of multi-element geochemical data indicates two geochemically distinct metal suites within the area of the gold-in-soil anomaly at Scheelite Dome. The first suite, characterized by Au-Te-Bi ± W ± As, possesses the stronger gold association and is typical of intrusion-related gold occurrences elsewhere in the Tombstone gold belt. The second suite displays a metal association of Ag-Pb-Zn-Cd-Sb ± Cu ± Au, which is more characteristic of mid-Cretaceous Ag-Pb-Zn mineralization in the Keno Hill district, located approximately 60 km to the east-northeast. Field observations, combined with soil geochemistry, suggest that the different metal associations are paragenetically related.

These assemblages were deformed prior to the mid-Cretaceous intrusion of three plutonic suites and the deposition of two suites of volcanic rocks.

Sedimentary rocks previously mapped as undifferentiated Lewes River and Laberge Group strata are separated into their respectve groups and further sub-divided into several members. Lewes River Group rocks form three units that are Carnian and older, Norian, and Upper Norian in age and are represented by siliceous siltstone and calcareous sandstone, conglomerate and limestone respectively. Laberge Group strata are divided according to lithology and dominated by siltstone-sandstone couplets and massive siltstone with lesser conglomerate and volcanogenic sandstone. Volcanic rocks previously mapped as Hutshi Group are divided into the dominantly mafic and submarine, MiddleTriassic Joe Mountain volcanic complex (JMVC) and the dominantly felsic and sub-aerial Mount Byng volcanic complex (BCVC). The volcanic and sedimentary rocks generally increase in age from Middle Triassic to Jurassic from west to east across the map area.

Plutons cutting these strata belong to the M'Clintock Lakes (120 Ma), the Whitehorse (115 Ma), and the Mount McIntyre (109 Ma) plutonic suites. The predominantly felsic fragmental rocks of the BCVC are genetically associated with the Byng Creek pluton of the Mount McIntyre plutonic suite. The BCVC is nested into the country rocks and its eastern margin and is preserved as the rim of a tilted caldera.

Strata of the Laberge and Lewes River groups are folded throughout. Wavelengths are on the order of approximately 1-2 km, but are much tigter in black siltstone units and adjacent to northwest-trending faults. Faults are ubiquitous throughout the map area and form three sets. North-trending faults are the most common. They are spaced a few kilometres from each other and dictate the physiography and drainage of the region. Northwest-trending faults, in the northeastern corner of the map area control the Teslin River valley and juxtapose Yukon-Tanana rocks with Stikinia. Older faults are dominantly east-trending but are terminated or reactivated by younger faults.

Copper (gold-molybdenum-tungsten) skarns and gold-bearing quartz veins are the two mineral deposit types most likely to be discovered in the map area. The source of the placer gold in Sheldon Creek is unknown but may be related to gold veins in the JMVC, BCVC, Sheldon Creek volcanics or the surrounding sedimentary rocks. Hydrothermal activity in the JMVC is characterized by orange weathering alteration, breccias, and carbonate veins.

The sedimentary rocks are folded and cut by thrust faults and younger (?) normal faults. Steep normal faults with a variety of orientations cut all other structures. These faults host most of the veins and are well exposed in the mine workings.

Most veins contain galena, sphalerite, and tetrahedrite in a gangue of siderite and quartz with minor barite and calcite. Silver-lead ratios determined from the grade of ore shipments range from 55.5 g/t Ag : 1% Pb to 137.1 g/t Ag : 1% Pb

The age and origin of the gold-silver veins in the Plata-Inca camp is unclear.

Lithology in this area consists of Precambrian to Paleozoic metamorphic rocks, Paleozoic ultramafic rocks, Middle Jurassic pegmatite and aplite dykes, Late Cretaceous porphyritic dykes and volcanic rocks with intercalated sedimentary rocks, Quaternary alkaline basaltic dykes and Quaternary alluvial sediments.

Gold bearing, mesothermal quartz-(carbonate)-sulphide veins which trend NNE-SSW are hosted by metamorphic rocks north and south of Sixtymile River.

The mesothermal quartz-(carbonate)-sulphide veins are surrounded by successive envelopes of sericitic, K-feldspar and propylitic alteration. Two stages of vein mineralization are recognized in the northern part of the area, and three stages are recognized in the south part.

In the northern veins, pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and quartz are intergrown and formed first. These minerals are fractured and healed by second stage minerals, which include galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, carbonate and minor quartz.

Stage I mineralization in the southern veins is represented by quartz, and pyrite containing inclusions of other sulphides. Stage II is the main stage of precious metal enrichment, represented by arsenopyrite and galena which contain tetrahedrite, miagyrite and polybasite exsolutions. Stage I and II minerals are tectonically fractured, and healed by pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, freibergite and quartz of stage III. In both vein systems, gold enrichment is associated with arsenopyrite and silver enrichment is associated with galena. The evolution of hydrothermal fluids in the northern area is characterized by decreasing temperature (330°C to 280°C), salinity (12.8% wt.-% to 6 wt.-% NaCI equiv.), oxygen activity (log a(O2) = -30 to log a(O2) = -35), and sulphur activity (log a(S2) = -10 to log a(S2) = -12), as well as a slight increase in pH range (from >3.1 - <5.2 to >3.3 - <5.4).

In the southern vein system the fluid evolution characterized by a decrease in temperature (330°C to 150°C), salinity (18.3 wt.-% to 10 wt.-% NaCI equiv.), oxygen activity (log a(O2) = -29 to log a (02) = - 52), and sulphur activity (log a(S2) = -9 to log a(S2) = -18, as well as a slight increase in pH range (>3.2 - <5.3 to >4.1 - <5.9).

The following conclusions can be drawn about the fluid composition and mineral enrichment process in the fossil geothermal system of the Sixtymile River area. Deep seated fluids which circulated in the metamorphic rocks were characterized by high temperatures (above 300°C), high salinities (about 18 wt.-% NaCI equiv.) and pH values between 3.1 and 5.2. These fluids are similar to alkaline chloride fluids of active geothermal systems. Arsenic was transported as H3AsO3°-complex, gold as Au(HS)2- and lead, zinc, iron, copper as MeCl2° complexes. The first stage mineralization resulted from reaction of this deep-seated fluid with the wall rock. Second and third stage mineralization is believed to result from the mixing of two fluids with different physico-chemical characteristics.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:34","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The metamorphic rocks are also cut by Cretaceous(?) feldspar-porphyry dykes with an average thickness of 2 m.

The mineralization appears to be structurally controlled by NNE-striking faults and a set of NNW-trending joints. The vein minerals consist of gold, pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, hessite/stuetzite, tetradymite, Au-Ag tellurides, tennantite, hematite, pyrrhotite, quartz, and carbonate. Gold occurs as: 1) ""free gold"" in cracks and interstices of quartz gangue, 2) inclusions in galena, usually rimmed by hessite, 3) minute grains associated with chalcopyrite and galena in aggregates of coarse-grained pyrite and 4) individual grains or fracture fillings in iron hydroxides.

The coarse-grained gold in Livingstone Creek appears to be derived from gold-quartz veins in the metamorphic bedrock.

Flow rhyolites forming a dome in the Tarn Zone area, 1.5 km east of Grew Creek, pass westward into a succession of rhyolitic ignimbrites and air fall tuffs, exposed along Grew Creek and in the Main Zone, 500 m west of Grew Creek. These rhyolitic rocks are faulted against fluvial sediments to the north, along the W-E Fault, and basaltic rocks to the west. In the Main Zone, the volcanics, sediments, and the W-E Fault all dip steeply to the north.

The gold-silver mineralization forms an elongate tabular zone within the rhyolitic tuffs. The zone strikes parallel to the W-E Fault and dips vertically or steeply to the north. The eastern end of the mineralized zone is defined by a decrease in grade, whereas the western end is faulted off against the basaltic rocks. Within the zone, stockwork veins and hydrothermal breccias contain assemblages which include quartz, adularia, carbonates, quartz peudomorphous after calcite, pyrite, marcasite, and traces of arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, acanthite, electrum, silver selenides, galena, and sphalerite.

There is good correlation between gold and silver in drill core assays, with a gold::silver ratio of around 1::4 for the ore grade mineralization. The mineralization is strongly anomalous in arsenic and mercury, but there is only a weak correlation of mercury with gold and silver, with most high values for mercury lying above the gold-silver zone and associated with the W-E Fault. Arsenic conccentrations are elevated over much of the area but there is no statistical correlation with the locally high concentrations of gold or silver.

Outcropping rhyolitic rocks are hydrothermally altered to intermediate argillic and advanced argillic assemblages, whereas subsurface rhyolitic rocks are altered to quartz-adularia or illite-quartz assemblages adjacent to veins, and to illite-quartz-adularia ± carbonate elsewhere. Advanced illite-quartz-adularia ± carbonate alteration is accompanied by an increase in Na2O and decreases in TiO2, CaO and Al2O3. Basalts are altered to carbonate-chlorite (propylitic) assemblages, accompanied at an advanced stage by a slight increase in CaO and decreases in K2O, Na2O, SiO2, and Al2O3.

Mineralization postdated tilting of the host pyroclastic and sedimentary rocks. Episodic fault movements in the Tintina Fault Zone structurally focused the hydrothermal fluids by providing locally high secondary permeability, whereas the high primary permeability of the rhyolitic tuffs promoted the development of stockwork veins and breccias.

These profiles, although preliminary, demonstrate little variation in the thickness of valley-fill gravel (depth to bedrock) over that distance. Surveys show little difference in gravel thickness between the largest sediment source (White River) and more distal downstream reaches. The average thickness is approximately 10 m, which is equivalent to the maximum scour depth of the river. GPR surveys across the Tintina Fault along the Yukon River indicate a similar depth of fill compared to the upstream and downstream reaches from the fault zone, suggesting no significant recent vertical movement. These observations, when combined with the uplift history of the region (rates of 50-70 mm/ka determined in the Klondike area), suggest the region is likely undergoing either very slow uplift or is stable. No differential uplift is detectable within the error limits and sampling density of the GPR valley-fill method used in this study.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,geophysics","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:34","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

These rocks are intruded by Upper Triassic mafic and ultramafic sills and dykes and Early Cretaceous to Oligocene granitic rocks. At least two phases of folding are recognized that affect rocks throughout the mapped area. Early phase folds are likely associated with large, low-angle thrust faults. Reactivation of thrusts during younger strike-slip faulting may be responsible for refolding of the early folds. Several known mineralized showings occur within the Quill Creek area, including extensive nickelcopper- platinum group element mineralization associated with the ultramafic sills.

42599,"information","High level terraces along Lower Stewart River and parts of Yukon River","Surficial geology mapping of the lower Stewart River valley has revealed sets of high level terraces formed when the paleo-Stewart River and the paleo-Yukon River were at higher base levels during the Pleistocene glaciations and during preglacial time. These terraces are composed of bedrock and a variety of gravelly alluvial fill, some of which are glacial in origin, others appear to be nonglacial in origin. The terraces are dominated by pebble and cobble gravel deposits which are typically covered by aeolian sand and silt deposits.

The age of these high level terraces was determined by paleosol development, height, and relationship to glacial limits. At best, these are crude correlations which serve to model drainage evolution. For example, inferences can be made about the aggradation of these main valleys. A regional base level was established possibly in late Tertiary time which is identified as a bedrock terrace level above the present flood plain level. The timing of this feature is probably older than White Channel gravel age (Pliocene-Early Pleistocene). Subsequent aggradation of valley fill gravel in the Stewart River drainage followed. The style of deposition is considered nonglacial for this highest alluvial surface. The main rivers incised their valleys due to a lowering of base level; perhaps due to tectonic uplift and/or isostatic readjustment subsequent to a long period of stability.

Placer gold distribution on the terraces appears to be widespread. Gold grains are typically flat, smooth and smaller than 1 mm. Gravel sampling of lithofacies was conducted on these high level terraces followed by concentration of heavy minerals by sluicing and panning. Gold is present on many of these terraces. Favourable targets for placer exploration may be in tributary valley terraces which grade to the main trunk stream high level terraces or basal gravel overlying bedrock. Erosion of outwash terraces is believed to contribute gold to modern bars along the Stewart River.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:34","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

There are few published tectonic estimates for rock units older than mid-Cretaceous time for the area. The pluton is dominantly monzonite with syenite patches and a more mafic border phase. To the north and south of the pluton are spatially associated sill complexes that are chemically similar and coeval with the pluton. Acceptable geothermometry values from three sites suggest at the 95% confidence level that the pluton has not been tilted since crystallization. This is supported by the circular outcrop pattern of the pluton and the flat-lying host rocks. The pluton was sampled for paleomagnetic analysis at thirteen sites and six sites were sampled in sills from south of the pluton. Fifteen of the nineteen sites give a well-defined mean characteristic remanent magnetic (ChRM) direction for the pluton and sills at a declination = 6°, inclination = 78°, cone of 95% confidence = 9° and precision parameter = 20, corresponding to a paleopole at 110.6°W and 84.3°N (dp = 16°, dm = 17°). It suggests that the northern Stikine Terrane has undergone 21.1° ± 7.4° of net southward translation, or translation away from the reference pole, with respect to the North American craton since Middle Jurassic time. The estimate also suggests a net clockwise rotation of 33° ± 18°. This translation estimate is similar to that for the coeval Fourth of July Batholith that is part of the neighbouring Cache Creek Terrane and indicates that the Stikine and Cache Creek Terranes were proximal to one another at that time.

Sediment from these streams also contained concentrations of up to 7,700 ppm zinc and 360 ppm lead. These indications were subsequently traced to extensively mineralized outcrops of carbonate strata on east trending ridges about six miles in length. Twenty closely spaced diamond drill holes were bored in the general vicinity of the most promising outcrops in 1974 to determine the continuity and form of the richest mineralized zones. In 1975 a further 35 holes were bored on a wider spaced pattern to provide an estimate of the tonnage potential and overall distribution of the mineralization. The total length of the fifty-five drill holes is 20,448 feet. The Goz Creek prospect, owned by Barrier Reef Resources Limited, became conspicuous because of spectacular high grade outcrops which were easily examined by many geologists who visited the area.

Concentrations of Ag, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Hg, were analyzed in 166 specimens from 48 deposits; an additional 13 elements were investigated at a qualitative level. Analytical data is reported here. Analyses of variance indicate that minor element variations within single hand specimens, and analytical variations, are insignificant relative to between deposit variations. Furthermore, within deposit variations are small relative to between deposit variations; therefore, each deposit can be characterized by the minor elements in the sphalerite.

Probability graph analysis of all minor element contents define bi-modal distributions consisting of relatively 'high' and 'low' populations for most elements. Proterozoic and Lower Cambrain rocks host sphalerite 'high' in minor elements. Sphalerite 'low' in minor elements occurs mainly in Ordovician to Devonian hosts. These patterns are explained best by two ages of regional metallogeny, possibly reflecting two different mineralizing processes. A major shale basin, dewatering to produce metal-rich brines, is associated only with the younger hosts. Major unconformities and paleophysiography suggestive of karst environments are associated with the older host rocks.

42630,"information","Mineral zoning in the Keno Hill silver-lead-zinc mining district, Yukon","The Keno Hill-Galena Hill mining district of central Yukon has been a prolific silver-lead-zinc producer since the early part of the century. Typical orebodies are extensive vein systems with a mineralogy consisting of siderite, quartz, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and freibergite in varying combinations. The veins are restricted to steep SE-dipping fault zones principally contained within a brittle graphitic quartzite unit and some concordant greenstone bodies. The main silver lodes form a narrow east-west belt, 25 km long, and have been assigned a mid-Cretaceous age as have nearby granitic bodies and their associated tin and tungsten mineralization.

This study of the vein minerals indicates that groups of adjacent deposits have characteristic mineral assemblages distinguishing them from other groups; these form zones along the entire length of the belt. The following summarizes the principal mineralogical zones from west to east:: 1) pyrargyrite in quartz-siderite veins with some native silver, polybasite, stephanite, and acanthite are mainly in the west; 2) siderite, galena, sphalerite, and freibergite occur in most deposits but are found without the other index minerals on top of Galena Hill; 3) pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite are in deep vein exposures in the valley between Galena Hill and Keno Hill; 4) calcite is also in the deep veins along the eastern flank of Galena Hill but extends to the east onto Keno Hill; and 5) boulangerite-jamesonite and abundant quartz-arsenopyrite rich fractions of veins at the eastern end of the district overlap with the calcite zone. Higher gold values are recorded in zones 1, 2, and 5.

The changing mineralogical facies record an evolving environment of deposition in a continuous, 25 km long hydrothermal vein system. The western deposits are thought to be higher level, or laterally ""downstream"" equivalents of the eastern deposits.

This zoning sequence is typical and is well established in other regions of the world.

Vegetation species density and frequency on various substrates were compared with: age, slope and aspect of the site, and pH, particle size distribution, moisture content and organic content of the soill. In central Yukon, tailings are first colonized by ruderal (weedy pioneer) species such as fireweed and members of the Compositae (dandelion) family. These are replaced by willow-dominated communities after nine years. Willow communities support many species characteristic of the adjacent undistrubed black spruce forest, suggesting that the placer succession is similar to that of riverbank environments in interior Alaska. Revegetation of the tailings proceeds at the same rate for the first twelve years as does that following natural disturbance. Of the environmental factors examined, only age and slope were, statistically, associated with rate of revegetation. Both the percent cover and the number of species at a site were inversely associated with slope, suggesting that reduction of slope angle enhances vegetation regeneration.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The five are: Howards Pass, Driftpile (Gataga District), Clear Lake, Tom, and Jason (Macmillan Pass). NH4 was found in feldspars, but not in illites. This is probably due to a transferral of NH4 from illites to authigenic feldspars during regional metamorphism. NH4 in feldspars was found to increase in the hangingwall over the Howards Pass and Clear Lake deposits. Concentrations reached as high as 2000 ppm. Evidence suggests that NH4 halos around the other deposits were disturbed by detrital input.

These lavas have erupted in a transitional tectonic environment that reflects regional transpression along the Queen Charlotte transform-Fairweather-Totschunda Fault System and subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath North America. The volcanic province is composed of subalkaline basalt (31%), basaltic andesite (30%), andesite (21%), dacite (2%) and nepheline normative basalt (16%).

The hypersthene normative basalt is (in order of appearance) spinel-olivine-plagioclase ± Fe-Ti oxide ± clinopyroxene phyric, whereas andesite contains plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxide, clinopyroxene, ± orthopyroxene phenocrysts, and dacite and intrusive latite contain phenocrysts of plagioclase, ± clinopyroxene, hornblende, ± biotite, ± sanidine.

The nepheline normative rocks, where porphyritic, contain phenocrysts of olivine, plagioclase and hornblende. In the central part of the map area, the lowermost flows are nepheline normative basalt that are interbeddded with clastic sediments and overlain by basaltic andesite, andesite and volcanic conglomerate. This succession is overlain by basalt interbedded with clastic sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic rocks. In the southern part of the map area, alkaline basalt occurs at this stratigraphic level. The uppermost Wrangell lavas are andesitic with minor interbedded volcaniclastic rocks.

The hypersthene normative lavas of the St. Clare province are transitional in terms of their Na2O + K2O/SiO2 ratios between alkaline and subalkaline magma series and in terms of their FeO/MgO versus SiO2 ratios between tholeiitic and calc-alkaline series.

At the Logan and YP deposits, four phases of mineralization can be distinguished. The main sulphide minerals are sphalerite, galena, pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite. Silver is mostly confined to galena, but also occurs in tennantite-freibergite group minerals, stannite, Pb-Ag-Bi-sulphosalts of the matildite-galena series and lillianite homologues.

42644,"information","Overview of Yukon placer geology, gold production and prospects","The physiography and glacial history of Yukon bear directly on the geological setting, grade and economic viability of Yukon placer deposits. The limits of several advances of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet are evident in south central Yukon in the form of deposits and ice-marginal features left successively southeast by retreat of the three main glacial episodes.

The oldest, including multiple glaciations, was the pre-Reid at up to 3 Ma, succeeded by the Reid at up to 200 Ka, and the McConnell which ended approximately 10.3 Ka.

Yukon placer deposits are grouped into five broad categories based on age, gemorphic and sedimentologic characteristics. These are 1) Pliocene to early Pleistocene alluvial placer deposits preserved as high level terraces buried beneath non-auriferous overburden; 2) Pleistocene non-glacial alluvial placer deposits that occur as valley-bottom fill and low to high level terraces in unglaciated terrain; 3) Interglacial placer deposits that occur as valley-bottom alluvial fill or low terraces in drainages that have escaped the effects of glacial erosion; 4) Glacial placer deposits that have formed when gold from regional bedrock or paleoplacer sources was incorporated into glacial drift; and 5) Recent placer deposits that are found as colluvial deposits, valley-bottom alluvial blankets in gulches and tributary valleys, bar deposits in major river systems and beach and nearshore marine deposits.

Ten major regions produce placer gold in Yukon:: Indian River; Klondike; west Yukon (Sixtymile/Fortymile/Moosehorn); Lower Stewart; Clear Creek; Mayo; Dawson Range; Kluane; Livingstone and Whitehorse South. Since 1886, these areas have produced over 15 million crude ounces of placer gold, mainly from the unglaciated Klondike, west Yukon and Lower Stewart regions.

Many areas in Yukon remain unexplored for new placer gold deposits, both in unglaciated and glaciated areas. Areas of exploration potental in unglaciated areas include abandoned channels, oxbows and point bars, high level terraces, and tributary gulch and creek placers. In and along the margins of glaciated areas, pre-glacial or interglacial placer deposits may lie buried by glacial and glaciofluvial drift. Lower-grade placer deposits may have formed by glaciofluvial reworking of pre-glacial or interglacial placers. Non-glacial placer deposits may be found unconformably overlying glacial drift. Deeply incised interglacial valleys oriented obliquely to paleo-ice flow directions are also favourable locations for the preservation of economic placer deposits in glaciated areas.

Interest in exploring for new gold reserves has been sparked by new placer research and surficial mapping programs initiatied by the Yukon Geology Program and the Geological Survey of Canada. As this research continues to add to the understanding of placer gold deposits, exploration activity is expected to continue and new reserves in both unglaciated and glaciated areas may be found.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Excluding an anomalous result from the Carmacks Group, all previous tectonic estimates for terranes in the Yukon have been extrapolated from Alaska, British Columbia or the northwestern United States. The Mount McIntyre Pluton (109 Ma) and the adjacent Whitehorse Pluton (112 Ma), are granitic bodies that intrude Triassic and Jurassic sedimentary strata of the Stikine Terrane.

Paleomagnetic measurements on samples from 20 granitic sites yielded three clusters of ChRM directions. Each cluster is specific to a geographical area of the Mount McIntyre pluton. The two most northeasterly sites are from a region of mixed igneous rocks between the Mount McIntyre and Whitehorse Plutons and thus are not considered. The other 11 northern sites give a well-defined mean ChRM direction that is steeply down and northeast. Seven sites in the southern part of the pluton gave a well-defined ChRM direction that is directed steeply down and to the northwest.

The mean paleopole for the southern sites give an estimate of ~3900 km of northward or poleward translation with no rotation. In contrast, the paleopole for the northern sites in the Mount McIntyre Pluton suggests a poleward translation ~1600 km with ~80° of clockwise rotation. The motion must have occurred between 109 Ma and 45 Ma because earlier studies have shown that Stikine Terrane was fixed with respect to North America by Eocene time.

The southern sites of the Mount McIntyre pluton support an estimate of ~2300 km of northward displacement between ~70 Ma and 45 Ma as derived from the ~70 Ma Carmacks Group volcanics. The result from the northern sites is statistically similar to the value determined for the Whitehorse Pluton, as do several other igenous units in southern British Columbia. Geobarometric estimates, made to determine the nature of any post-crystallization tilting of the pluton, were inconclusive. The contrast in tectonic motion estimates for the northern and southern portions of the Mount McIntyre pluton can be accommodated by a large fault between the portions, but a more definitive explanation requires the accumulation of more paleomagnetic sampling, age dating and structural information.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

It is an elliptical area of volcanic rocks, Tertiary in age, and surrounded by hypabyssal rhyolite intrusives. Field and petrographic evidence, fluorite and tourmaline stockwork, breccia pipes, roof pendants, miarolitic cavities and spherulites in the nine Skukum rhyolites suggest that they were emplaced at a high level. The intrusives vary in composition from rhyolite to dacite. The variation in texture within and between the intrusives can be explained by different rates of crystallization, temperature differences and compositional variability.

Chemical data are in accord with the expected trends in a cogenetic suite of igneous rocks. Relatively low CaO and MgO, high SiO2 and anomalously low Sr concentrations indicate that the rhyolites were formed from a highly differentiated magma. Sr and Ba versus Al2O3 plots show that both k-feldspar and plagioclase were important fractionating phases. Rare earth element data further support this conclusion and also suggest that some accessory phase(s), such as monazite, allanite or fluorite help control the rare earth element behaviour. Partial melting of an already depleted source rock with residual plagioclase can also explain the patterns.

The Bennett Lake ring and associated dykes are petrographically and chemically similar to the Skukum intrusives. However, Zr and TiO2 are present in higher concentrations in the Bennett Lake complex, indicating that they were derived by a slightly different fractionation process.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42650,"information","Petrology and geochemistry of the Pattison Alaskite Pluton, Yukon","The Pattison Pluton is a high level Tertiary subaluminous alaskite that is part of a northwest trending chain of igneous intrusions in the Yukon Crystalline Terrane, southwestern Yukon. It is roughly circular in form with a diameter of about 18 km and a funnel-like profile. Crosscutting it are a series of shallowly dipping aplite dykes which intruded into open fractures. Compositionally and mineralogically, the alaskite body and aplite dykes are very uniform but the pluton is texturally and gradationally divided into a fine-grained upper border phase, a medium-grained graphic, strongly miarolitic, weakly porphyritic phase, and a lower coarse-grained phase.

Due to eutectic crystallization, no strong major element trends are found within the pluton and dykes. Trace element chemistry, however, shows an apparent liquid line of descent with the fine grained alaskite the least differentiated and the aplite dykes the most differentiated. The medium and coarse-grained alaskites plot in between these. Rayleigh fractional crystallization of alkali feldspar accounts for these trends.

Textural zonation evolved by the initial chilling of the originally H2O-poor magma at its upper edges. Crystallization of anhydrous phases from the melt had the effect of increasing the volatile pressure within the enclosed chamber. The volatiles migrated to and concentrated in the upper regions where the melting temperature was depressed, causing the pluton to crystallize from the bottom up. This allowed for the lower regions to reach more advanced stages of phenocryst crystallization, hence forming the lower coarse-grained alaskite. The volatile pressure eventually exceeded the confining pressure, resulting in failure of the surrounding rocks and retorgrade boiling, as well as vertical extension and lateral injection of residual magma due to filter pressing to form the aplite dykes. This final series of events also resulted in the formation of the graphic groundmass, straining of the minerals within the pluton, brecciation of some of the surrounding rocks, as well as quartz veining and molybdenum mineralization.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Plutonic rocks fall into three main groups: 1) biotite-muscovite (two-mica) granite in the southernmost belt which follows the trend of the McQuesten Anticline; 2) biotite-hornblende quartz monzonite, granite and granodiorite in the northern belt which follows the thrust faulted contact of the Hyland Group (Grit Unit) with the Road River Formation; and 3) hornblende-biotite syenite and associated quartz syenite, quartz monzonite, granite and tourmaline-orbicular granite along the north edge of the northern belt.

Tin-silver breccia veins and skarns are spatially associated with the two-mica granites, while tungsten-gold skarns and sheeted veins are associated with biotite-hornblende granite, quartz monzonite and granodiorite. The concentrically zoned syenite intrusion in the northern belt (ZETA) includes all the plutonic phases (two-mica granite, biotite-hornblende granitoids, and hornblende-biotite syenitoids), and links them cogenetically through the fractional crystallization process.

Both North American and allochthonous rocks were ductilely deformed and concurrently metamorphosed under upper greenschist to amphibolite facies conditions at temperatures of 450-650°C and pressures greater than or equal to 6 kbars, probably during Late Triassic to mid-Jurassic time. North-northwest-striking foliation dips steeply in the western portion of the TSZ, but flattens to the east in North American autochthonous rocks.

The TSZ in the combined eastern Laberge/western Quit Lake map area is divisible into three distinct elongate structural domains parallel to the NNW-trending TSZ. Domains are identified by the distribution of differently oriented stretching lineations, Le1 and Le2, which formed during non-coaxial ductile deformation, and their associated ""motion planes."" Le1 trends westward and plunges down dip, whereas Le2 trends NNW-SSE and plunges shallowly. Le1 and Le2 are associated with the same mineral assemblages and formed under similar metamorphic conditions. Silicate mineral assemblages record temperatures up to 625°C, and pressures to 8 kbars; carbonate assemblages record temperatures in the range 350-500°C. The difference in temperature suggested by these assemblages may reflect lower temperatures of ductile flow and recrystallization in carbonate rocks.

Elongate lensoidal domains of Le1 are separated from each other by narrower NNW-trending zones of Le2, forming a regional-scale anastomosing shear zone. Two western domains of Le1 chiefly comprise allochthonous rocks, or rocks of uncertain affinity; however, the eastern domain comprises North American autochthonous rocks, previously considered to be unaffected by TSZ metamorphism and deformation. Macroscopic and microscopic kinematic indicators consistently record right-lateral or top-to-the-north movement parallel to Le2. Kinematics associated with Le1 are more complex. To the west, kinematic indicators record west-side-down (normal) movement parallel to Le1; elsewhere, both reverse and normal movement are recorded. Field relations suggest Le1 began forming earlier than Le2, followed by a period during which both Le1 and Le2 formed, and ended with movement parallel only to Le2. These geometries and movement histories indicate that rocks of the TSZ and structurall associated autochthonous rocks record a history of right-lateral transpression along this portion of the North American margin during Triassic-Jurassic time. Movement consisted of early tectonic shortening at a high angle to the ancient margin, followed by a period of right-lateral translation approximately parallel to the Mesozoic margin of western North America.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

These rocks rest conformably on grey shale with thin ferruginous siltstone beds, and are overlain conformably by grey siltstone with chert pebbles and siderite concretions. To the west, the formation thickens dramatically, as the ironstone-bearing member interfingers with and overlies dark grey shales and thin sandstones.

In addition, the amount of clay and silt in gold-bearing gravels has a direct bearing on the treatment necessary for gold liberation during the placer mining process, and the resulting use of water for this process. The program consisted of sampling the pay or sluiced portion of an actively mined placer deposit (bank material), in conjunction with instrument monitoring and sampling the water upstream and at the discharge point of the mine.

Knowledge of the grain size distribution of pay gravels will allow interpretation of the fluvial depositional environment, which can be used as a tool for placer deposit exploration. Sampling and analysis of the water will result in the ability to relate the grain size distribution of the active mine site (bank material) to the suspended solids concentration of the water, and the subsequent impact mining of the deposits has on the water quality in the area.

Paleomagnetically, the White Channel gravel is normally magnetized at one site, suggesting a pre-Brunhes normal chron (likely recording the Gauss chron, or an earlier sub-chron older than 2.6 million years). These results are broadly similar to those paleomagnetic investigations of the White Channel gravel in the Klondike River drainage. The Ross gravel is magnetically reversed and may be correlated to the Matuyama reversed chron (older than 780,000 years). Furthermore, the Ross gravel has a younger normally magnetized alteration overprint presumably of Brunhes age (younger than 780,000 years). Dominion Creek gravel overlies the Ross gravel in lower Dominion, Sulphur and Gold Run creeks, and at all sites sampled revealed normal polarity, presumably of Brunhes age (younger than 780,000 years). Radiocarbon ages from the Dominion Creek gravel range from older than 47,000 years BP to 6000 years BP, and likely represent a composite unit of fluvial activity over the last several hundred thousand years.

The oldest and volumetrically largest placer deposits are associated with the Ross gravel, and little gold appears to have been subsequently mobilized from bedrock sources during the last 800,000 years.

Each area has its own geomorphic setting and depositional history which is related to its glacial history. Several Quaternary glacial advances have been described in Yukon, and these are generally divided into three episodes, commonly known as the pre-Reid, Reid and McConnell, in order of oldest to most recent.

Placer deposit in the unglaciated Klondike, Sixtymile, Fortymile and Moosehorn drainages occur in valley-bottoms, alluvial fans, in gulch gravels and as high level terraces. Placer deposits in glaciated areas occur in variably reworked and buried valley-bottom, bench and gulch settings, in auriferous glacial till and glaciofluvial gravels, and in non-glacial gravels which were deposited on top of glacial drift.

Targets for new placer deposits in unglaciated areas include drainages such as Stewart, North Ladue and Yukon Rivers which lie outside of the pre-Reid glacial limit. Mineable placer deposits may also have formed on top of pre-Reid glacial drift and may be buried in valleys beneath Reid-age non-glacial alluvium. Prospective areas of this type are drainages which are near lode gold deposits in the Clear Creek area and in drainages near felsic volcanics in the Dawson Range. At the limits of both the Reid and McConnell glaciations, auriferous pre-glacial or interglacial gravel can often be buried by glacial and glaciofluvial deposits. Low-grade auriferous glaciofluvial gravel can also be derived form the reworking of pre-glacial gold-bearing gravel. Prospective areas for these types of placer deposits are the South McQuesten River valley and the creeks draining the Ruby Range on the east side of Kluane Lake. Within the McConnell glacial limits, placer deposits may be found in valleys oriented obliquely to the paleoflow direction of the glacial ice. Economic to sub-economic placers may also be found along meltwater channels within the McConnell ice limit. Prospective areas of this type of deposit are the drainages which lie to the north of Livingstone placer camp.

The possibilities for new placer mining areas within glaciated areas must be investigated, and new placer gold reserves will undoubtedly be found within these areas.

42660,"information","Placer deposits: Their formation, evaluation, and exploitation, Yukon","The formation of placer deposits has several prerequisites. They include a source for the gold, a mechanism to concentrate it, and time for the concentrating mechanism to work. The source of the gold could be gold-quartz veins, gold-bearing sulphide deposits, or previously formed placer deposits.

Concentration of gold in placer deposits occurs through erosion. Concentrations may occur in residual eluvial and deluvial deposits overlying and close to a lode gold source. Most placer deposits have, however, been further concentrated through the action of moving water in streams or on beaches.

Typical sites for accumulation of placer gold deposits occur where the rate of flow decreases. Such sites include the inside of meander curves, at decreases in stream gradients, at the confluence of creeks, and where physical obstructions such as irregularities in the bedrock surface, or the surface of the sand and gravel occur. In deposits of meandering streams, gold occurs in distinct pay-streaks at the base of the deposits. In deposits of braided streams, however, the gold occurs erratically throughout the deposits.

A variety of sampling methods and other techniques can be used to explore and evaluate placer deposits. Black and white aerial photographs and infra-red photographs are used to identify areas of interest. Geological mapping of placer deposits is done to establish the distribution of the horizons bearing valuable minerals and identify potential impediments to mining.

Layered metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, about half the area mapped, include a basal unit of quartz-rich schist, psammite, metapelitic schist, and grit with a laterally continuous sandy marble marker high in the unit; a unit made up of a variety of mafic metavolcanic (?) rock types interlayerd with carbonaceous phyllite, grey quartzite, quartzofeldspathic psammite and grit; Devono-Mississippian felsic metavolcanic (?) rocks interlayered with carbonaceous phyllite and grey quartzite, and an upper mafic metavolcanic (?) unit with quartzofeldspathic psammite and grit, and carbonaceous phyllite and quartzite. Metarhyolite of the third unit hosts the Kudz Ze Kayah massive sulphide deposit and underlies numerous gossans. The succession is thought to be upright based on an interpretation of the structure of metarhyolitic rocks at Kudz Ze Kayah.

The remainder of the area is underlain by metaplutonic rocks. Quartz-feldspar metaporphyry near Kudz Ze Kayah is thought to be a hypabyssal intrusion coeval with the adjacent metavolcanic pile. Coarse-grained granitic to monozonitic Grass Lakes Orthogneiss of probably Early Mississippian age underlies much of the area; it and its apophyses intrude the layered units. The undated North Lakes Metadiorite is thought to intrude the Grass Lakes Orthogneiss. Three large undated bodies and numerous discordant dykes of weakly foliated biotite-muscovite granite intrude the layered succession.

Ultramafic rocks occur in two settings in the eastern part of the area. Discontinuous 10 to 100 metre-scale bodies of ultra-mafic rock occur along the contact between actinolite-chlorite schist and calcareous quartzose psammite (above) near the Pack occurrence. A km-scale body of ultramafic rock also overlies the same calcareous quartzose psammite in the prominent peak along the east side of the map area. An axial surface trace of a recumbent north-closing fold lies between the two localities suggesting that the ultramafic rocks are folded.

All rocks except biotite-muscovite granite and ultramafic rocks are strongly foliated and lineated. The prominent foliation transposes an older foliation and bedding and is axial-planar to south-vergent folds mappable at 1:50 000 scale. This deformation occurred after the intrusion of the Grass Lakes Orthogneiss (therefore post-Mississippian) and waned during the emplacement of biotite-muscovite granite. Two weak later phases of deformation comprise sporadically developed north-trending, east-vergent folds of the second-phase foliation and regional arching of the second phase foliation over a southwest-trending hinge in the central part of the map area.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Methods of stratigraphy, paleomagnetics, soil analysis, tephra chronology, and relative geomorphic preservation are employed to differentiate and describe Quaternary events. Glaciations, from oldest to youngest, are the pre-Reid (multiple early to mid Pleistocene glaciations), Reid (> 200 000 years), and McConnell (14 000 - 29 600 years). Interglacials are represented by organic deposits from Stirling Bend and Ash Bend, in addition to Wounded Moose and Diversion Creek paleosols preserved on pre-Reid and Reid surfaces.

During their maximum extent, pre-Reid ice sheets inundated the study area leaving isolated nunataks on Klondike Plateau and the northern part of Stewart Plateau near Syenite Range. North trending intervalley channels on Stewart Plateau represent confined ice flow in Stewart and McQuesten River valleys from ice obstructions in Tintina Trench. Undifferentiated pre-Reid surficial materials are thick in the lowlands of Klondike Plateau and Tintina Trench, areas proximal to the terminus of multiple pre-Reid glaciations. Reid ice terminated at Reid Lakes in the Tintina Trench. The McConnell ice sheet impinged into the east boundary of the study area, terminating approximately 20 km northeast of Stewart Crossing.

Petrographic analysis of woody material from the oldest pre-Reid deposit at Stirling Bend (unit A), suggests a late Tertiary age. Paleomagnetic measurements from overlying loess (unit B) and glaciofluvial sediments (unit C) have undetermined polarity. Remaining pre-Reid glacial and interglacial units from Stirling Bend have normal polarities and represent deposits from either a subchron within the Matuyama reversed chron or early Bruhnes normal chron. Reid deposits underlie Sheep creek tephra at Ash Bend suggesting a minimum age of 200 000 years. McConnell deposits are late Wisconsin age.

The distribution of surficial materials, related to multiple glaciations, physiography, and fluvial order contrasts, may govern the distribution of placer occurrences in McQuesten map area.

42690,"information","Sedimentology and stratigraphy of Duncan Creek placer deposits, Mayo, central Yukon","Placer deposits in the Mayo area occur in a wide variety of geomorphic settings, including alluvial fans, gulch gravels, valley-bottoms (alluvial plains), and bedrock terrace (bench gravel) settings which have been variably buried and reworked by glaciofluvial processes. Placer gold is also known to occur in glacial till and glaciofluvial gravels especially where these sediment types are close to bedrock.

Three major Quaternary glaciations (the pre-Reid, Reid and McConnell, in order of oldest to most recent) and their associated interglacials have modified the drainage and topography of this area, and these events have affected the formation, preservation and proportionate size of the District's placer gold deposits.

Duncan Creek, a tributary of the Mayo river which drains Mayo Lake, is one of the most actively-mined drainages in the Mayo District. Placer mining began in the Duncan Creek area in the early 1900's and has continued almost continuously to the present day. Gold production from Duncan Creek in the last 15 years has been nearly 20,000 crude ounces, with historical production estimated to be at least twice that for the last 95 years.

Although the McConnell ice limit only reached into the first few kilometres of the Duncan Creek valley at its mouth and its headwaters, associated glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sediments have inundated the valley to depths of up to 40 or more metres. Gold-bearing gravels are currently being mined beneath this thick cover of barren overburden.

Preliminary sedimentological and stratigraphic data indicate three main lithostratigraphic assemblages:: 1) Crudely stratified, imbricate boulder-cobble gravel and muddy boulder-cobble diamict; 2) Stratified cobble-pebble gravel, stratified sand and laminated silt; and 3) Stratified silt, massive boulder-cobble gravel and silty boulder diamict.

Lithostratigraphic assemblage 1 is gold-bearing and is interpreted as Reid-age subglacial or proximal glaciofluvial outwash and Reid-age proximal alpine glacial till. Gold in these sediments is concentrated either as a function of hydraulic interaction with bedrock topography, or as a result of incorporation and dispersion of a pre-existing placer deposit formed during a previous interglacial period. Lithostratigraphic assemblage 2 is interpreted as an interglacial wandering gravel bed river indicated by several fining upward sequences and wood radiocarbon dated at 32 320a.  ±1270 B.P. (Beta-86851). Lithostratigraphic assemblage 3 is interpreted to be McConnell age glaciolacustrine silt, glaciofluvial outwash and glacial till.

The Keno Hill Silver District (United Keno Hill Mines) lies a few kilometres upstream of the placers and native silver nuggets have been recovered during present and historic placer mining. Lode sources of gold are also known to occur on nearby Mt. Hinton, which indicates the gold in the placers is likely from local bedrock sources. The ubiquitous and extensive nature of facies assemblage 2 combined with the possible existence of other hardrock sources of gold indicates that a significant potential exists for more placer gold reserves in the same drainage.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42691,"information","Sedimentology of a high level terrace placer gold deposit, Klondike Valley, Yukon","Significant economic concentrations of placer gold were first recognized in an intermediate level terrace near Dawson City in the late 1980's Regional surficial mapping has shown the distribution of many high level terraces of pre-Reid, Reid and McConnell age in central Yukon, but the relationship between economic gold concentration and terraces is not well understood.

Sedimentological study of an intermediate level terrace near Dawson City suggests two river types have been dominant:: the first, a 'wandering gravel bed river' is characterized by moderate sinuosity, later accretion deposits, limited sand facies, and generally fine gravel; the second, 'proximal braided river' is characterized by multiple channels, very thick and crudely imbricate gravel, low bed relief, and a maximum particle size greater than the underlying wandering gravel bed river deposits.

The gold-bearing 'wandering gravel bed river' assemblage is typical of present-day conditions with river processes dominated by lateral migration and high gravel transport rates through the system, conducive to heavy mineral concentration during an interglacial period. The 'proximal braided river' is characteristic of nearby glacial ice and rapid sedimentation resulting in poor heavy mineral concentration. The transition from a wandering gravel bed river to a proximal braided river is suggested to mark the onset of a pre-Reid glaciation in the Southern Ogilvie Mountains. The sedimentology of the intermediate terrace gravels suggests a geomorphic model which may be used for exploration of terrace placer deposits in central Yukon with a similar pattern of regional glaciation influencing terrace formation.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

This work began with the initiation of regional mineral potential assessments by the Yukon government (e.g., Bradshaw and vanRanden, 2004). The quantitative method used for regional mineral assessments in Yukon is based on a method developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which uses the mineral deposit models of Cox and Singer (1986). The reader is encouraged to consult this reference for further discussion on the fundamental purpose for defining mineral deposit models. In general terms, resource assessments require that tracts of land be assessed on the basis of probability for the occurrence of one or more specific deposits of a particular type with previously defined grades and tonnages. In the course of conducting regional mineral potential assessments, grade and tonnage information for deposit types that occur or potentially could occur in Yukon was compiled, grade and tonnage curves were constructed, and deposit models were assigned to known mineral deposits and occurrences (i.e., Yukon MINFILE occurrences).","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Green first thought that a distinctive type was defined by those associated with Lower Cambrian limestone. Gabrielse and Mulligan emphasized the well-defined stratigraphic and structural controls of those located near the Casssiar Batholith, and inferred that they were related to that intrusion. Stratabound lenses far from large intrusions are recent discoveries. Exploration geologists first considered them to be Paleozoic syngenetic/diagenetic deposits, but later exploration has revealed their epigenetic nature. No explanation has been offered for the origin of veins within the Cretacoeus intrusions.

A series of faults, striking northeast and dipping steeply southeast, host the silver-lead-zinc lode deposits.

In excess of 65 ore deposits and prospects have been identified within the district. The principal lode deposits occur within the Central Quartzite in areas where brittle failure of the competent quartzite has allowed open areas conducive to ore deposition. Ore zones are also known to occur in the Lower Schist where a competent unit, such as greenstone lense, forms one or two of the walls of the vein fault.

The Husky Mine, located near the base of Galena Hill, is currently the main underground producer. Ore production from Husky to December 31, 1984 has totalled 359,450 tonnes (396,230 tons) grading 1450 g/t Ag (42.32 oz/ton). The lead and zinc content within Husky Deposit averages 3.96% and 0.27% Zn. The 10.7:1 silver to lead ratio (ounces silver to percent lead) in the Husky Deposit is the third highest among the district's major silver producers. The low zinc content is also unusual in light of the fact that the Husky Deposit exhibits very little evidence of oxidation.

The Husky S.W. Deposit is located 1400 m southwest of the Husky shaft. The Husky S.W. Vein zone is a highly fractured breccia structure with a quartz-rich gangue. Mineralization occurs as native silver with some argentite (acanthite) and stephanite within fracture veinlets with a pyrite/graphite matrix. The ore is completely non-visual.
The amount of lead and zinc within the deposit is very low (0.2% Pb aand 0.03% Zn).

The term ""sluice box"" is a broad generic term that encompasses just about any device that confines a slurry of water and gravel to a fixed, usually rectangular cross-section at a constant gradient.

Yukon placer miners still appear to regard the sluicebox as the most cost-effective method of treating placer gold deposits. Though simple to construct and operate, the behaviour of a sluice box is really quite complex. This is part of the reason that it has not been extensively researched.

The feed rate of water or gravel per foot of sluice width, riffle configuration and feed geometry of sluice boxes vary considerably throughout the Yukon. This great variety of operating practices seems far in excess of that required. In this respect, the Yukon is no different from the rest of the North American placer mining industry.

Biotite-hornblende granitic rocks of the Simpson Range Plutonic Suite (SRPS) intrude and metamorphose the volcanic sequence and related sub-volcanic intrusive rocks, and coupled with previously published U-Pb dates (345-350 Ma), this relationship implies that the SRPS is a distinctly younger pulse of magmatism.

Hyland Group rocks have undergone four ductile deformations (D1-D4 ) in the structurally thick (>10 km) Jura-Cretaceous Tombstone high strain zone. Kinematic features indicate overall top-to-the-northwest movement on shallow shear planes. Four different types of quartz veins developed during ductile deformation and are associated with a progression from ductile to brittle-ductile behaviour. Three major brittle structural trends postdate ductile deformation. A set of sinistral ~165° striking faults developed and are crosscut by secondary east-west fracture zones in Hyland Group rocks. The Tombstone Plutonic Suite was then emplaced in a broadly east-west oriented belt, with some local control exerted by the ~165° oriented faults. Continued development of the east-west fracture set after the Tombstone
Plutonic Suite intrusion, resulted in an extensive system of gold-bearing sheeted quartz veins. Finally, sinistral reactivation and associated quartz-tourmaline veining occurred on ~165° oriented structures.

Preliminary analysis of fault geometry and connectivity suggests the most favourable sites for mineralization are east-west fracture zones connected to ~165° oriented faults. Other favourable structural sites include misoriented segments of ~165° faults and possibly northeast-striking structures connected to ~165° faults.

Large scale F2 folds have E-W axial trends coincident with those of F1, and moderately NNE-dipping axial planes and axial planar foliation (S2). D2 also produced small-scale, SSW-verging folding of S1 along E-W to NW trending axes.

Shallowly SSW-dipping thrust fault surfaces, and regional analogies suggest NE-directed thrusting (D3). An extensional event (D4) coincided with the timing of mineralization. Normal displacement along the S-dipping Peel Fault resulted in the separation of the map area into two stratigraphic domains:: predominantly unit 1a argillites exposed in the northern domain, and predominantly unit 1d limestones exposed on the southern domain. Subsequent to the development of the Peel Fault, a series of NNW trending listric and planar normal faults separated the map area into four structural domains:: 1) western half-graben; 2) central horst; 3) eastern graben; and 4) eastern planar high-angle fault blocks. Axial-planar extensional veins developed along drag folds associated with graben-forming faults are intimately associated with manto-style orebodies. Several orebodies extend from listric normal faults in the preferentially mineralized limestone facies, suggesting that D4 faults were primary conduits for mineralizing fluids. There is no regional equivalent of D4. D4 may represent brittle response to the emplacement of a pluton.

The last deformation event (D5) produced a reverse fault that conceals the eastern portion of the Peel Fault (D4).

Placer gold was found along the Stewart River on point bars in 1884 prior to the discovery of gold in the Klondike area. This was the first indication that the Yukon Territory contained important economic concentrations of placer gold.

This study is concerned with the late Tertiary and Quaternary geology in the Lower Stewart River and adjacent Yukon River above Dawson. Previous systematic surficial geological mapping and testing for placer gold on the high-level terraces along these rivers has been limited. This report describes the sedimentology and stratigraphy of key gravelly exposures in this area because similar high-level terraces in the Fortymile River drainage in Alaska had been mined for gold for many years. Work of this type also provides information on the physical characteristics of gravelly deposits (e.g., grain size distribution) which may assist regulatory decisions on placer mining in the lower Stewart and Yukon drainages.

These changes occur across a north-northwest-striking corridor along which deposits and prospects in the overlying felsic metavolcanic schist are distributed (including Kudz Ze Kayah). Syn-volcanic, syn-mineralization faulting would explain the association of these deposits with the observed changes in host rock characteristics. Using similar arguments, syn-mineralization faults have been inferred on the Hat Trick property southwest of Fire Lake, as well as in Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks of the Campbell Range succession. Finally, stratigraphic differences between coeval rocks in the hanging wall and footwall of the Money Creek thrust imply that the thrust may have re-activated a syn-depositional structure.

The penetrative fabric of the metasedimentary rocks indicates generally eastward-vergent layer-parallel shear. The deformation of the siliciclastic rocks is thus constrained at older than 181 Ma. The absence of resetting of the Rb-Sr isotopic ratios of the Jurassic pluton indicates that the mid-Cretaceous magmatism was emplaced at a shallow crustal depth. Since the Jurassic pluton has both a 'juvenile' Sr isotopic ratio of 0.7045 and chemistry indicative of a largely mantle-derived source, a subduction-related setting for magma generation is likely.

Quartz deposition was ubiquitous throughout the sequence. Arsenopyrite and pyrite occur underground in bands near outer edges of the vein, implying early precipitation. Repeated movement along curved planar surfaces opened more space for sulphide deposition. At some point in the sequence, gold was introduced and deposited in the wider portions of the vein and in other areas.

Although precipitation of gold was probably controlled by physio-chemical conditions operating during ore deposition, the mechanism for concentration of gold into ore shoots is unknown. Recurrent opening and closing of the fissure along warped planar surfaces generated available open spaces for movement of gold-rich fluid.

If there is a structural control on ore shoot occurrence at Venus, it is most likely that the ore is concentrated in shoots by physical fluid behaviour and available open space during deposition of gold-bearing fluids.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:36","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Vein mineralization is hosted by lithologic units ranging from the Proterozoic-Paleozoic. Basement Metamorphic Complex, through the mid-Cretaceous Mt. Nansen volcanics, to the Late Cretaceous Carmacks volcanics. The mineralized areas also contain numerous porphyry dykes that are spatially associated with gold veins, and historically have been thought to be genetically linked to them. Dykes belonging to both the Mt. Nansen and Carmacks Groups are present, although Mt. Nansen dykes are the more common. Dykes proximal to mineralized veins are strongly altered to sericite and clay.

Volcanic and subvolcanic rocks of the Mt. Nansen and Carmacks Groups can be distinguished chemically on the basis of their K content; the Mt. Nansen Group is high-K calc-alkaline suite while the Carmacks Group is a shoshonitic suite. Radiometric age determinations constrain the age of the Carmacks Group to approximately 70 Ma, while the age of the Mt. Nansen Group is approximately 105 Ma. K/Ar dates for altered Mt. Nansen dykes, however, range from 94 to 61 Ma, reflecting resetting of Mt. Nansen ages by a Carmacks-age hydrothermal event. This hydrothermal event appears to have been responsible for much of the mineralization in the southern Dawson Range.

Alteration in porphyritic dykes proximal to mineralization is characterized by a strong depletion of Na, reflecting the replacement of feldspar by sericite and clay minerals. Altered dykes also display a general depletion in the ore metals Pb, Zn, and Cu, suggesting that these elements were mobilized from the host rocks during alteration and precipitated in nearby gold-rich base metal veins.

The extensive belt of Hyland Group rocks hosts gold mineralization in numerous occurrences from southeastern Yukon to the Dawson City area and is part of the Tintina gold belt.

The Fer property was originally staked in 1996 to cover the largest cluster of gold anomalies (>90th percentile for gold) in a regional fine-stream-sediment sampling program. Soil geochemistry on the property has outlined an area of about 2000 by 500 metres in the Southern Grid area with anomalous gold and arsenic values (>25 ppb Au, >125 ppm As).

The Kona deposit is hosted within a strongly deformed and metamorphosed mafic to intermediate volcanic succession of chlorite-quartz and chlorite-actinolite-quartz schists. This volcanic package is overlain by a metasedimentary succession composed primarily of finely laminated carbonaceous phyllite that locally contains 1 to 20 m thick beds of micaceous volcanic-derived sediments.

The Kona deposit consists of two parallel northwest trending zones of copper-cobalt-gold volcanogenic massive sulphide mineralization: East Kona and West Kona. East Kona is made up of two distinct horizons: the Upper Horizon and the Lower Horizon. The Upper Horizon occurs immediately below the contact of the metasediments and the metavolcanics while the Lower Horizon occurs 40 to 70 m deeper, within the mafic volcanics. The mineralization of East Kona consists primarily of pyrite with lesser amounts of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite occurring as massive to banded sulphides with local lenses of massive magnetite. The mineralization across West Kona changes from magnetite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite hosted within a grey siliceous matrix in the east, or down dip, through massive pyrite and lesser chalcopyrite into massive pyrrhotite in the west.

42733,"information","The Origin and Setting of Anomalous Arc Magmatism in the Wrangell Volcanic Belt, Southwest Yukon","In the Wrangell Volcanic Belt (WVB) a northwesterly increase in volume of calc-alkaline versus transitional (sodic alkaline/calc-alkaline) magmatism is accompanied by a migration in the locus of magmatic activity. The space-time-composition relationships reflect oblique convergence between the North American and Pacific plates over the last 17.3 million years. Compositional- temporal trends are particularly well preserved in the four stages of volcanic stratigraphy in the St. Clare Creek field (17.3-6.5 Ma). Initially, alkaline olivine basalts, hawaiites and mugearites were erupted from small, isolated shield volcanoes in the axis of a continental molasse basin. The alkaline lavas were followed by an early stratovolcano stage of transitional trachybasalts and high-Fe basaltic trachyandesites, succeeded by basaltic trachyandesites, trachyandesites, trachytes, rhyolites and rare basaltic andesites. Widespread basaltic fissure eruptions dominated the third volcanic stage. The late stratovolcano stage consisted of renewed eruption of intermediate and felsic transitional lavas.  A systematic temporal-chemical relationship between early alkaline and younger transitional and calc-alkaline lavas in the St. Clare Group is illustrated by a decrease in FeO/MgO, Na+K/Si, NB/Zr/Y, and an increase in Rb/Zr with increasing stratigraphic levels. Primitive basalts are non-primary and show variable degrees of fractionation between large ion lithophile (LILE) and high field strength element abundances.  A model is proposed in which the alkaline shield volcano and early stratovolcano stage magmas formed by progressive melting of a rising mantle diapir in response to local extension along the Duke River fault. Early Fe-rich magmas may have undergone clinopyroxene fractionation at high pressures, but most magmas appear to have differentiated in the near surface environment via fractional crystallization and local magma mixing. With the onset of Yakutat subduction, progressively larger amounts of slab-derived, LILE-enriched fluids metasomatised overlying peridotite, which in turn melted to form primitive, late-stratovolcano stage magmas.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:36","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

In the Anvil District, thick glacial deposits have consistently hampered exploration. From the initial (massive sulphide) discovery in Vangorda Creek, twenty years elapsed before the Grum deposit was discovered only two kilometres to the northwest. This work examines the utility of till geochemistry as a method to trace mineralized soil/till samples back to their source rocks in the Anvil District. The Anvil District was last glaciated during the McConnell glaciation, which had a significant impact on the local terrain. The relatively swift-flowing Cordilleran ice sheet deposited thick sequences of till in low-lying areas and eroded southeast-facing slopes and hill summits in the Swim Basin and Vangorda Plateau. This type of glacial history is conducive for till geochemical exploration. A 12 km 2 till grid was sampled northwest of the Faro deposit to map the glacial dispersion train. The till geochemistry on the -230 mesh fraction (silt and clay) indicated a broad dispersion plume for lead, zinc, and copper, extending more than 5 km west of the Faro Pb/Zn deposit. A section of the dispersion train may have a palimpsest origin. The soil geochemistry on the -80 mesh fraction, from 1964 data, indicated a much narrower dispersion plume extending directly from the Faro deposit.

The livingstone Creek area in south central Yukon has supported placer mining operations for over 90 years. Present activity is centred on gold-bearing gravels buried by thick Pleistocene glacial deposits. The placer gravels are associated with coarse interglacial stream and gulch deposits and they are overlain by fine-grained, proximal, glaciolacustrine sediments.

During the last glaciation, damming of gold-bearing, high gradient interglacial tributary stream channels by main valley ice caused rapid environmental changes. Depositional processes dominated over erosion in the ice-marginal lakes, and thick sequences of fine-grained suspension deposits, debris flow sediments, and deltaic sands and gravels accumulated. In addition, when glaciers expanded and overrode the area, these thick deposits protected the underlying placer gravels from subglacial erosion and dilution. Subglacial tills were probably deposited by lodgement, meltout and flow. During deglaciation, ice-marginal sedimentation again dominated. Post-glacial streams later cut through the glacial sediments and re-exposed the gold-bearing gravels.

Stratigraphic, sedimentologic and geomorphic evidence from the Livingstone Creek area suggests that small tributary valleys, oriented transverse to the former direction of ice flow in the adjacent main valleys would make good exploration targets in regions of new placer interest.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:36","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The Skukum complex was previously thought to represent a similar structural and volcanic setting to the BLCC. Study of the Skukum complex began in the summer of 1982 with the idea that it represented a cauldron subsidence feature and that an improved understanding of its geology would assist in developing potential targets for mineral exploration. The geology in the area is complex due to the discontinuous nature and incomplete exposure of volcanic units and is further complicated by severe faulting.

The author found that the Skukum complex differs from the BLCC in three respects:: 1) the presence of a bimodal suite of extrusive rocks (which suggests the tapping of two magma chambers), 2) its structural complexity and the absence of major cauldron subsidence and 3) the variability of depositional environments within the complex.

Postglacial alpine sediments in this region include talus, rock glaciers, alluvial fans and Neoglacial till and the spatial distribution of these sediments is controlled by factors such as lithological properties and site characteristics which in turn influence weathering and erosion. As a result, the sediment distribution may give clues about the bedrock weathering and site conditions. The method of cross tabulation is a powerful tool that can provide insight into the spatial patterns of landforms, and processes such as sediment accumulation and landscape denudation. It allows an examination of the distribution of bedrock and surficial geology units with respect to each other and to other map variables such as elevation, slope and aspect. The analysis of the spatial distribution of sediment and the calculation of rates of landscape denudation for different bedrock units then require the use of a G.I.S.

Altered fragments are multicoloured and give the appearance that they are transported, and exotic, but all are locally derived. Structures in relatively unaltered breccias suggest that brecciation was accompanied by mylonitization and faulting. Repeated brecciation, metasomatism, and faulting characterize development of the breccias. Small gabbro and diabase dykes and sills are associated with the breccias. The breccias contain numersouss, small occurrences of copper, iron, barium, molybdenum, uranium, cobalt, gold, and silver.

Sulphide minerals consist of pyrite, sphalerite and galena. Textures vary from very fine-grained massive pyrite with bands of amber sphalerite and steely-gray galena (zebra ore), to medium-grained botryoidal sphalerite and galena within a gangue of buff-coloured Fe-Mg carbonate. Chalcopyrite is conspicuous by its absence. The deposit has been intersected by nine drill holes over a strike length of 500 metres and a down-dip length of 250 metres. Thickness of the sulphide deposit varies from 2, to more than 25 metres. The deposit and host stratigraphy strike northwesterly and dip at 45 degrees to the southwest.

The localities are located within the Whitehorse Trough about 5, 20 and 40 km east of its margin with the intruded Coast Plutonic Complex. At each locality, 2.5-cm-diameter cores were drilled from 32 clasts of mainly igneous provenance and 8 more from the conglomerate matrix, totaling 120 cores, and yielding 190 specimens in all. The specimens were analysed using standard paleomagnetic demagnetization and testing techniques. The matrix, mostly greywacke in composition, yields characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) directions carried by pyrrhotite that give coherent steep downward directions. The clasts, at all three localities, yield paleomagnetic conglomerate tests that show statistically random ChRM directions. This leads to the conclusion that the clasts were not remagnetized by the event that remagnetized the matrix, which was likely caused by hydrothermal fluid flow during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene Laramide Orogeny. Furthermore, these conclusions support earlier studies by demonstrating that felsic plutons in the Whitehorse Trough likely carry primary ChRM directions, e.g., the 75 Ma Mount Lorne stock, the 109 Ma Mount McIntyre pluton, the 112 Ma Whitehorse batholith, and the 186 Ma Teslin Crossing stock.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Coast Plutonic Complex,geophysics","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Eight northerly and westerly sites display a mean direction A (D=337, I=69°; a 95 =7.6°, k=54). Another 11 sites appear to be lightning-struck, or exhibit unstable remanence, and 3 sites in a fault-bounded block to the southeast carry an anomalous northeast upwards ChRM direction B.

Aluminum-in-hornblende geobarometry at 10 sites defines emplacement depths of ~16 km in the north and west, and ~19 km in the southeast. The batholith has probably not been significantly tilted since its emplacement, but it may be subdivided into two separate intrusive phases or structural blocks that have experienced differential uplift. Ambient temperatures at 16-19 km were too high for magnetite to record an enduring remanence, so the observed ChRMs likely record uplift of the batholith through ~15 km depth, at 180-170 Ma. Both A and C ChRM directions are similar to those expected for Early Jurassic and Late Cretaceous reference poles, respectively, suggesting that the Yukon-Tanana Terrane is not far-traveled with respect to cratonic North America since Early Jurassic time.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Regional Geology,remnant magnetism","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Distinctive layers such as the White River tephra provide important chronostratigraphic control and can be used to interpret the cultural and environmental impact of ancient large magnitude eruptions.

The Coffee Creek area is underlain by a sequence of shallowly to moderately south to southwest-dipping Paleozoic metamorphic rocks that are considered to be part of the Yukon-Tanana terrane and are intruded by the Cretaceous Coffee Creek granite along a west to northwest-trending contact. During the 2010m drilling program, structurally controlled gold mineralization was discovered in all major lithological units underlying the Coffee property. Importantly, these mineralized zones correspond to a number of discrete structural corridors. The gold zones are steeply dipping and characterized by extensive silicification in addition to sericite and clay alteration accompanied by variable As-Ag-Sb-Ba-Mo enrichment. Polyphase breccias of both hydrothermal and tectonic origin, in addition to andesitedacite dykes, are common within the gold-bearing structural corridors. The dominant sulphide is pyrite, although trace arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and stibnite are observed locally. The similarity of breccia textures and alteration/sulphide mineralogy between all gold zones currently defined on the Coffee property implies a common mineralizing event.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Coffee Creek,Yukon-Tanana terrane,polyphase breccias","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Graphitic staurolite-biotite schist, associated with the Kluane Metamorphic Assemblage, underlies the western Dezadeash Range, whereas cordierite-biotite gneiss, previously correlated with the Late Proterozoic - Paleozoic Nisling Assemblage, is exposed in the eastern and southern regions. A terrane boundary was placed in the central Dezadeash Range.

Recent petrographic studies reveal a southeastward increase in metamorphic grade. Prograde appearance of cordierite partly obliterated an older schistosity and caused a fabric change near the postulated terrane boundary. Furthermore, typical continental margin rocks, such as marble and quartzite, are not observed. This suggests that all metamorphic rocks in the Dezadeash Range can be correlated with the Kluane Metamorphic Assemblage, whereas Nisling Assemblage rocks occur in the Coast Mountains to the east. Therefore, the terrane boundary is located in the Dezadeash River valley, further southeast than previously thought.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Petrology,bedrock mapping","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

This project is aimed at investigating the geological relationships and mineral potential of the Kluane Schist, the Ruby Range batholith and the Yukon-Tanana terrane in southwestern Yukon. Bedrock mapping at 1:50 000-scale followed a 400 m line-spaced aeromagnetic survey flown in the winter of 2010. Preliminary results indicate the presence of a northeast-dipping structural stack through an ~40 km-thick crustal section, whereby the Kluane Schist occupies the lowest structural level and the Yukon-Tanana terrane the highest. The Ruby Range batholith intruded along the contact between the Kluane Schist and the Yukon-Tanana terrane, and was emplaced late in the deformation history. An orthogneiss/paragneiss unit of unknown tectonic affinity was mapped structurally between the Ruby Range and the Kluane Schist. Detrital zircon analyses from two samples of Kluane Schist indicate that the onset of deposition for this metasedimentary sequence occurred after ca. 94 Ma. Two significant metamorphic events, dated at 82 and 70 Ma, affected the Kluane Schist. This indicates that original structural juxtaposition between the Kluane Schist and the Yukon-Tanana terrane pre-dated intrusion of the Ruby Range batholith. 

Mineral potential in the Coast Belt area is significant and includes porphyry Cu-Mo-Au, epithermal Au-Ag and orogenic Au occurrences. The upper level of the Ruby Range batholith is most prospective for porphyry and epithermal mineralization, while the Kluane Schist is most prospective for orogenic Au mineralization.

They range from Cambrian to Quaternary in age and include a wide range of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rock types. Lower Cambrian siliciclastic and carbonate rocks of the Cassiar Batholith predominate.

Three phases of structures are identified. First phase structures include bedding and slaty cleavage, of which the latter is attributed to late stage diagenetic recrystallization. Second phase structures trend northwest and include crenulation cleavage and related folds and lineations. They are attributed to northeast-southwest compression resulting from accretion and obduction of allochthonous rocks during arc-continent collision in Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous time. Third phase structures are approximately 90° to the second phase structures and trend northeast. They include joints and related folds and lineations and are attributed to dextral transcurrent movement on Tintina, Kechika and Cassiar faults.

Precious and base metal mineralization is found mostly within Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and Cretaceous plutonic rocks and forms predominantly veins and replacement lenses. The dominant sulphides include galena, sphalerite, pyrite and chalcopyrite. Arsenopyrite, freibergite, tetrahedrite, pyrrhotite, wolframite, cassiterite, stannite, fluorite and lepidolite are also present. Common gangue minerals include quartz, siderite and iron and manganese oxides. Mineralization appears to be structurally controlled by the northeast-southwest jointing and, to a lesser extent, lithologically controlled by limestone-phyllite contacts. It is attributed to hydrothermal solutions migrating along the joints and was probably deposited approximately 50 Ma ago.

Study of stream flow variation over the open water season can be readily accomplished with a variety of conventional methods, but understanding the behaviour of streams in winter low flow is hampered by uncertainty. Knowledge of absolute low flow can be vital in anticipating environmental effects of mining projects and describing the possible effects of climate change.

Streamflow has been measured using variations of dye dilution and tracers of all kinds for many years, but these were always cumbersome. Recently, advances in instrumentation have allowed a variation of the salt dilution method to be a practical method for streamflow measurement.

Geoff Kite of the National Hydrology Research Institute (NHRI) has experimented with a streamflow measurement technique using injection of a salt slug and calculation of flow based on the conservation of mass. The method is described in re 'Measuring glacier outflows using a computerized conductivity system', Journal of Glaciology, Vol. 40, No. 134, 1994 (attached as Appendix A), and 'Computerized Streamflow Measurement Using Slug Injection', Hydrological Processes, Vol. 7, 227-223 (1993). A software program converts the conductivity readings to flow, with a computer coupled to the conductivity meter through digital/analog converter.

This report summarizes a project undertaken by Laberge Environmental Services for the Mining Environment Research Group (MERG) during the late winter low flow period of 1998/1999. The Salt Slug Injection method of stream flow monitoring as described by Kite was tested to determine its applicability to Yukon mining monitoring situations under late winter low flow conditions.

42866,"information","Williams Creek Project, Thermal Leach Project Test Heap Leach Project at Carmacks, Yukon Territory","An extensive heap leach field test was conducted during the 1993-1994 winter season at Carmacks, Yukon Territory. The test itself utilized an approximately 5-m-diameter crib loaded with composite ore from the northern (higher grade) end of the Williams Creek deposit. The ore was stacked to a total height of 7 m, including one meter of ore atop the emitter system. This matched the commercial heap height planned for Williams Creek at the time the test was started. By insulating the side walls of the crib, lateral heat flux was minimized. Thus, the crib replicated an interior segment of the commercial heap.

Leaching was done at a flow rate that matched those commonly used in industry. Leachate temperature was about 21°C, a level achieved with no external heat input other than normal process heat transferred from electrowinning to the leachate via solvent extraction.

An analysis of the test results showed that the winter conditions at Carmacks were quite typical of those expected at the mine site. Conditions included ambient temperatures below -40°C and an average temperature of -13°C.

In terms of leachate flow to and from the crib, the test ran continuously from late September through mid-February. In spite of some flow system problems, leaching continued unabated. There was no freezing in the interior of the crib or in the solution reservoir at the bottom. Freezing was limited to the insulating ore over layer and a few isolated points high in the crib near the outer walls.

The test clearly demonstrates that year-round heap leaching of Williams Creek ore is practical. The heap appears to be adequately insulated by a 1 m ore layer on top of the emitter system. Normal process heat should be sufficient to maintain a leachate return temperature of approximately 20 degrees Celcius at the heap. However, provisions for some supplemental heating in the commercial operation may be desirable. This would permit recycle of the heated solution if electrowinning goes off-line or if there is a long run of exposed leachate pipeline back to the heaps.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:38","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

At each site, profile surveys were conducted near known depths to bedrock (drill holes, shafts or excavations), overburden GPR velocities were measured with common mid-point (CMP) velocity surveys and overburden resistivity was measured with horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM) resistivity soundings. Survey sites were located in frozen deposits in unglaciated terrain, in thawed deposits in glaciated terrain and in frozen deposits in glaciated terrain.

In frozen unglaciated deposits in the Klondike and Moosehorn areas, GPR penetration varied from 10-28 m and averaged 19 m. Signal attenuation in thawed black muck and scattering within boulder layers limited penetration at two sites to about 10 m. The weathering of phyllitic and schistose rocks to clay enhances bedrock reflections; weak bedrock reflections were recorded due to a lack of dielectric contrast in deposits underlain by resistant bedrock. GPR performance is enhanced by surveying during winter or late spring when the zone of seasonal thawing is thoroughly frozen. Under optimum conditions, strong continuous bedrock reflections were recorded over distances of several hundred metres and accurate bedrock mapping was possible with a minimum of confirmatory drill holes.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:38","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Following discovery and initial exploration of the TEA claims, the present owners have carried the property to the production stage through the construction, machine assembly and test operation of a beneficiation mill at Ross River.

The following conclusions were made by this study:
1) A bedded barite deposit has been identified on the TEA property in the Selwyn Mountains of the Yukon. It is of suitable tonnage to support any likely scale of production (5000 to 10,000 tonnes per year) for at least 25 years.

2) The barite is of suitable grade such that with moderate beneficiation (from a mine run grade of approximately 4.15 S.G., to drilling mud grade of 4.20) it should find a market in both northern Canada or Alaska, enjoying a transportation cost advantage over materials presently brought from Nevada.

3) The ore is amenable to beneficiation, based both on the preliminary laboratory work by Lakefield Research of Ontario and on the production scale test runs By H. Coyne and Sons Ltd., with the Mill at Ross River.

4) Laboratory equipment techniques of types approved by the American Petroleum Institute are being used for quality control of product at the Ross River mill. A barite standard of known and accepted specific gravity is used to check the calibrations and performance of this quality control system.

5) A determined market analysis has been conducted.

After mining operation was ceased in 1969, there remained potential environmental issues with regards to the tailings that had accumulated at the Site during mine operation. A potential environmental issue associated with these tailings is the possibility that Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) could occur.

To ensure that ARD reactions do not occur in the future at the site, the federal government (with assistance from consultants) developed a reclamation plan for the tailings at this site. A silty clay material was used to cover the tailings to prevent oxygen and water from entering and reacting with the iron-sulphides to produce ARD. EBA Engineering Consultants Ltd., the Carcross Tagish First Nation and partners, on behalf of Mining Environment Research Group and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, conducted a study to evaluate the performance of the silty clay cover over a tailings impoundment at the Site between September 2000 and January 2001.

Data-gathering equipment was installed at the Site. Three rounds of testing and monitoring at the site were completed to gather data regarding the thickness, oxygen concentrations, temperatures and moisture levels within the tailings and the cover.

This report presents the conclusions and recommendations of the study::

- Observations show that the cover system was installed properly and according to the design
- Preliminary data show that the cover is working to reduce the amount of moisture and oxygen entering the tailings
- It would be valuable to collect more data at the Site to observe trends and see how well the cover systems will work over time in a northern climate.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:38","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42885,"information","Quaternary Geology and Till Geochemistry of the Anvil District (Parts of 105K/2, 3, 5, 6 and 7), central Yukon Territory","The integration of till geochemistry and glacial geology into Yukon mineral exploration has been largely underused. In the Anvil district, thick glacial deposits have consistently hampered exploration. From the time of the initial discovery made in Vangorda Creek, it took an additional 20 years before the Grum deposit was discovered only 2 km to the northwest. This work examines the utility of till geochemistry as a method to trace mineralized soil/till samples back to their source rocks in the Anvil district. The Anvil district was last glaciated during the McConnell glaciation, which had a significant impact on the local terrain. The relatively swift-flowing Cordilleran ice sheet deposited thick sequences of till in low-lying areas and eroded southeast-facing slopes and hill summits in the Swim basin and Vangorda plateau. This type of glacial history is conducive for till geochemical exploration. Evidence for a late glacial Cordilleran re-advance is discussed and has implications on prospecting in the district.

A 12-km2 till grid was sampled northwest of the Faro deposit to map the glacial dispersion of mineralized sediment. The till geochemistry on the -230 mesh fraction (silt and clay) indicated a broad dispersion plume for
lead, zinc and copper extending more than 5 km west of the Faro Pb/Zn deposit. A section of the dispersion train may have a palimpsest origin. The soil geochemistry on the -80 mesh fraction, from 1964 data, indicated a much narrower dispersion plume extending directly from the Faro deposit. The geochemical changes at depth in the till stratigraphy were examined at the Vangorda mine. Results showed that anomalous lead concentrations, unlike zinc concentrations, were found throughout the 20-m till column. Regional till sampling was carried out in three areas peripheral to the known massive sulphide deposits. Results from these sampling programs highlighted anomalies in lead, zinc and copper. Overall, the application of till geochemistry proved to be successful in the Anvil district. Applying similar techniques to drift-covered terrain elsewhere in the northern Cordillera would be beneficial.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:39","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42887,"information","Investigations into Passive Wetlands Treatment of Mine Drainage to Remove Heavy Metals at Various Sites at United Keno Hill, Central Yukon","Wetlands have been used for decades in the treatment of municipal wastewater (sewage) in many parts of the world. Since the 1980s, wetlands have been used in the treatment of acid mine drainage, usually resulting from coal mining. Recently, natural and constructed wetlands have been researched and utilized for the removal of metals from mine drainage. Most of these wetland treatment systems have been designed and used in temperate climatic areas where permafrost, extreme minimum temperatures, and limited plant productivity is not a great concern. There is interest in northern regions on the possibility of the application of wetlands as a passive treatment system for metal contaminated mine drainage.

A research program investigating this possibility was initiated in the summer of 1995 in the vicinity of the United Keno Hill Mine property in central Yukon. A pilot wetland treatment system was constructed in May 1995 near the Galkeno 900 adit to determine whether it could improve the quality of its discharge. Sedges (Carex aquatilis) were obtained from a local natural wetland unaffected by any mine drainage and planted in the plot. After the plants were allowed to establish, untreated mine drainage was introduced to the wetland. Monitoring of the wetland continued for one season. Initial results showed that treatment within the wetland reduced concentrations of zinc, cadmium, manganese and nickel. Sulphate reduction in the sediments and formation of insoluble metal sulphides appeared to be the primary process responsible for their removal.

In 1999, further investigations were completed on this pilot project and on some of the natural wetlands which receive untreated mine drainage. Due to insufficient volumes of water flowing through the examined wetlands, they could not be fully evaluated as to their performance in the treatment of waste water. However, sediment analyses showed that metals had been attenuated. The colonization of the transplanted sedges (Carex aquatilis) in the constructed wetland was evaluated. Successful growth and propagation was apparent. These local sedges appear to be a hardy species capable of withstanding transplanting, and appear to thrive with a minimum of effort.

Metal uptake in plant tissues was also examined. Low levels were documented throughout the study area with the exception of high zinc concentration in sedges that were collected from the No Cash wetland. As Carex aquatilis, the dominant sedge found in the local wetlands, is generally unpalatable to herbivores, the low and incidental levels of metals found within the tissue of the sedges, poses little environmental concern. Overall, the preliminary results indicate that there is good potential for the use of wetlands to treat metal contaminated mine drainage.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:39","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Accurate sampling and deposit evaluation would enable planning for cost-effective mining and reclamation. However, sampling placer gravel accurately is an extremely difficult task due to the nugget effect (inclusion or loss of a single particle of gold) and any errors are compounded by the small size of the drill samples. Additional sampling errors result from contamination, splitting and fire assaying.

There is very little impartial, accurate information available to guide the selection of modern drills.

Drilling penetration was influenced by: 1) extent of freezing, 2) clast size, 3) distribution of clast size, and 4) degree of cohesiveness. Out of twenty-three holes, twelve reached bedrock and thirteen were gold-bearing. Maximum drill hole depth reached was 36 ft (11 m). Eleven holes were drilled adjacent to previously drilled larger diameter holes for gold value correlations. Six of these holes were known to be gold-bearing; our drilling indicated the presence of gold in five out of six holes. Small gold particles recovered from our drilling have a variety of shapes which range in size from 0.1 mm to 2 mm.

The ATV drill rig field tested in this study met most of the objectives of this project but gave mixed results. The ATV drill rig:
- is limited to terrain of relatively smooth microtopography
- is helicopter transportable but requires a medium sized helicopter
- can penetrate most surficial materials found in typical Klondike placer deposits except for coarse gravels and some frozen gravels
- is an acceptable tool for studying the general stratigraphy of Yukon placer deposits, although vertical sections are more representative of stratigraphy
- can detect the presence of gold in penetrable stratigraphy
- recovered gold from virtually every gold-bearing hole previously drilled by larger drill rigs but gold values were not as accurate as results from larger diameter drilling.

This particular ATV drill rig is limited by an old technological design and worn mechanical components which make it unsuitable for future projects of similar nature.

42903,"information","Placer Gold Dredging Using an Excavator and Floating Processing Plant","This report provides information on a method of placer gold dredging. This dredging method differs from conventional bucket line gold dredging in that it uses a combination of land-based and floating dredging equipment. An excavator is used for digging the gravel, and a floating processing plant is used to process the gravel and stack tailings.

Using this combination of equipment offers many advantages. The cost of mining placer gravel is extremely economical; we have calculated mining costs at 90 cents per loose yard of gravel processed. This mining method also has environmental advantages. Total reclamation of the mined area is achievable and inexpensive. All water used in processing the gravel is recycled, so that there is no discharge of effluent to the watercourse.

The method has limitations. Only certain types of placer reserves can be mined. For example, the ground must be thawed to bedrock depth, and have a higher water table or the ability to hold a pond.

Design details and specifications for the equipment used in the mining system are discussed. General design information is given for each of the components used in the dredging system. We have provided detailed specifications for our own equipment as an example. Operating procedures are outlined; topics covered include equipment assembly and start-up, mining through a deposit, shut down procedures, and reclamation of the mined area.

Because of the current low gold price and rising operating costs, placer mine operators must explore new mining methods to remain profitable. As well, mining methods which minimize environmental impact must be adopted. This dredging method has the advantage of both lower production costs and minimal environmental disturbance. As well, reclamation is easily achieved and cost-effective.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:39","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

For this study, leach columns were commissioned in the laboratory to evaluate metal mobility from treatment sludges. In addition, sludge densification by the freeze-thaw mechanism was studied.
Sludge samples from effluent treatment operations at United Keno Hill (UKH) and Faro mine sites were used in this study. This project has been divided into two main tasks; a leaching study and a freeze-thaw study, but conducted in the laboratory and in the field. This final report presents the results of the sludge characterization, the freeze-thaw study and the leaching study.
The composition of the acid mine drainage sludge produced at Faro and UKH mine sites were different as compared to typical lime treatment sludge. The metal composition of the mine water was very low, in particular for iron. While the pH of the wastewater was near neutral, the addition of lime was required mainly to precipitate zinc. The metal content of the sludge was low and the neutralization potential was very high which was in accordance with the high carbonate content measured in the sludge. The United Keno Hill sludge was mainly composed of calcite. Instead of calcite, the Faro sludge had as a major consituent aragonite, a pseudomorph of calcite crystals.
The sludge characterization revealed that the lime treatment process at both sites could be optimized. The origin of the high carbonate content of the sludge was probably from the lime quality used and from a high carbonate concentration in the mine water. Mineralogical results revealed evidence that minor amounts of calcium carbonate is from primary precipitation during the lime addition. Also, larger particles of calcium carbonate were also identified in both sludges which are thought to be from the lime used to precipitate metals. The lime treatment process could probably be improved by optimizing the slaking temperature, agitation time rate and using the proper chemical reagents to precipitate metals.
The freeze-thaw mechanism evaluated in the field increased the percent solids of the sludge fromm 23% to 60% for the UKH and from 28% to 58% for the Faro sludge. The freeze-thaw study conducted in the laboratory showed final percent solids values in the same order. The capability of the sludge to dewater so easily is explained by the low amount of iron hydroxide in the sludge. Because no particle repulsion force or bond water are associated to the iron hydroxide phase. The high solids content reached in this study was mainly due to natural dewatering rather than the freeze-thaw mechanism.
In terms of chemical stability, the column and the SPLP studies revealed that the metal release in minimal because of the high neutralization of both sludges. The variation of the temperature did not have any significant impact on metal mobility. Nickel and zinc were released to significant levels for both sludges when the sludges were subjected to the TCLP.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:39","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The goal of this project is to confirm or deny the key theoretical advantages of fine fraction sediment sampling as outlined in YGS Open File 1993-9 (G), and to develop practical and efficient techniques for collecting and processing the samples. Those key theoretical advantages are less local sample site variation, improved reproducibility, and the potential to preferentially define anomalies associated with significant bedrock mineralization.

Five study areas were selected in Yukon. Four of these areas contain known gold mineralization that has been mined in the past or contain significant drill indicated reserves. The Mt. Skukum deposit is a low sulfide quartz carbonate vein system that was mined in the mid 1980s. Ketza River is a sulfide-rich manto-style deposit with significant oxide reserves that was mined in the late 1980s. Dublin Gulch is a gold-bearing stockwork hosted within intrusive, similar to the Fort Knox gold deposit at Fairbanks, Alaska. Brewery Creek is a disseminated gold deposit hosted primarily within structurally disrupted intrusives.

Samples of -2000 micron sediment were collected from streams draining these areas of known mineralization, as well as from streams draining areas with no known significant mineralization but with erratic gold values from government sponsored regional geochemical surveys (RGS), and from streams that have only background gold values from RGS. Gold concentrations for each sample were determined by duplicate 30 g fire assay and one 10 g aqua-regia analysis. Values for 32 other elements were determined by ICP analysis.

Evidence from this orientation survey demonstrates the potential to improve the success rate of reconnaissance exploration for gold by collecting fine fraction sediment samples as a first step in exploration. Increased project cost at this stage could be greatly offset by more efficient and successful follow-up programs.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:39","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The probe is slowly lowered down a water well and as it is lowered, it measures the conductivity of the soils surrounding the well. As the probe is lowered, any changes in the electrical conductivity of the ground indicates either:: 1) changes in the levels of contaminants (metals like zinc in this case) in the ground, or; 2) changes in the type of soil - for example if there is sand and then a layer of clay or silt. In order to distinguish whether the change is due to 1) or 2) a gamma probe was also used. The gamma probe is also slowly lowered down the well and it only measures changes in the type of soil. By comparing the readings of the two probes, one can determine what vertical zones in the soil were being affected by changes in the levels of contaminants in the soil and the soil's groundwater.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:39","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The mines were only active, however, when copper prices were high. Ultimately, the drop in copper prices after the first World War, the discontinuous nature of the copper deposits, and the high cost of transport brought an end to production in the copper belt for half a century.

In the 1960s and 1970s, modern mining technology made it profitable to mine copper ore on a large scale, an undertaking that had proven uneconomical in the early days. Nonetheless, New Imperial Mines Ltd., later Whitehorse Copper Mines Ltd., had much in common with those early mines. Transportation costs were still high, the extent of mining development depended on outside capital investment and world copper prices, and there was still a close connection with the nearby community of Whitehorse.

Previous research indicates that manufactured flocculants could help miners meet these standards.  Flocculants enable particles within water to contact each other and agglomerate to form larger particles which will settle out more rapidly.  However these manufactured flocculants are expensive and may deposit foreign (deleterious) materials in the discharge waters.  Based upon prior government research, it appears that volcanic ash might act as a natural flocculant.

Seven samples of volcanic ash were collected from various sites in the Yukon which were close to active placer mining areas.  The samples were dried, sieved and analyzed to determine their characteristics.  The ashes were found be quite different in grain size and possible source.

Lab testing concentrated on two samples of ash and sediment from the Big Creek Area (west of Carmacks). A series of tests were completed on the sediment samples, with varying amounts of ash being added.  Readings were taken initially, and at 1 hour and 24 hour intervals to obtain the levels of material in suspension (suspended solids) and the measure of light penetration through the sample (turbidity).    The objective of adding a flocculant (in this case, volcanic ash) was to decrease the amount of material in suspension and increase the amount of material settling out.

Preliminary results from this study indicate that the addition of volcanic ash (in amounts of 1 to 16 grams per litre) to sediment samples appears to be successful in decreasing the amounts of material in suspension and increase the amount of material settling out.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:39","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

42935,"information","Experimental Trials for Restoring Disturbed Sites in Permafrost Areas Using Bioengineering Techniques","Placer mining has over a one hundred year history in the Yukon Territory. The majority of placer mining has taken place in the zone of discontinuous permafrost. Within the discontinuous permafrost zone, vegetated valley flats and north-facing slopes generally are underlain with permafrost. The permafrost thickness is highly variable and may reach depths of 60 meters. The active layer covering the permafrost also varies greatly in thickness.

To access gold bearing gravels, the removal of extensive quantities of overburden is usually required. Once this insulative cover is removed, the thermal equilibrium of the permafrost is disrupted and thawing occurs. This affects the stability of soils and vegetation and slope failure may occur. The extent that exposed permafrost melts depends partly on the amount and form of ice content. As melting progresses, the potential for mass movement of soil increases. Melting permafrost usually results in a wetter environment than was initially present, which further affects the natural revegetation process.

Bioengineering is the use of living plant materials to perform engineering functions such as erosion control and stabilization of steep slopes. Although bioengineering methods are now commonly used in the stabilization of steep problem slopes in more moderate climates (Polster, 1997), experimentation with these techniques in areas underlain with permafrost is still required. Advantages of using bioengineering systems are that they can be installed without machine access (which in permafrost areas would disturb the site even more), they strengthen with age, and they are less expensive than traditional hard engineering practices.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:40","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Under a proposed new management regime, the Yukon's placer mining industry will be managed through an adaptive management framework, with the aim of striking a balance between maintaining a viable placer industry and the protection and conservation of aquatic ecosystem integrity and fish populations. The effectiveness of the regime at achieving this balance will be monitored and assessed with appropriate adjustments to the requirements as required. The report recommended that a number of protocols be prepared and implemented in order to monitor the effectiveness of the new management system and among these is one with the primary objective of assessing and monitoring watershed health. A draft Watershed Health Monitoring protocol was completed July 1, 2006, and is currently being reviewed and considered by first nation, territorial and federal government agencies, industry and conservation organizations, and the general public.  The draft protocol aims to provide for a process to help assess how effective the new
management regime is for maintaining watershed health and to generate monitoring results that will be used to guide the adaptive management framework assessment and adjustment phases.
After consideration of a number of methods, the Reference Condition Approach (RCA) was selected for assessing and monitoring watershed health under the draft protocol.  There were a number of reasons for this choice:
- It is the most robust of many biomonitoring methods
- It is the basis of regional programs in Canada (it is an accepted design under the federal Environmental Effects Monitoring program), and programs in other countries, several USEPA programs in the United States, national programs in Australia and the United Kingdom, and has been adopted under the European Water Directive.
- An RCA program has been underway in the Yukon for a number of years that could be immediately applied to the placer mining areas and augmented by future fieldwork.
When the draft protocol was in preparation in the spring of 2006, meetings were held among those already conducting some type of stream sampling program associated with the Yukon placer mining industry. This included The University of Western Ontario, the federal Department of Fisheries & Oceans, and Environment Yukon Fisheries section. These three groups agreed to collaborate and carry out RCA sampling in 2006 in a manner consistent with that provided for in the draft Watershed Health Monitoring Protocol in order to ""test drive"" the methodology and assess its effectiveness at achieving the new management regime's objectives. Follow-up Geographical Information System March, 2007 3 (GIS) data collection and data analysis were also carried out as provided for in the draft protocol.

In general, petroleum potential is inferred to decrease both westward, and with increasing depth and stratigraphic age.

No crude oil potential can be estimated due to an inferred lack of oil-prone sources in strata of suitable maturity.

Selous area (105K/16, 105N/1), Yukon","The Myschka property overlies a large mineralized area within and adjacent to a 1200 m by 600 m Cretaceous Tombstone Suite granodioritic intrusion. Mineralization is controlled by at least four wide east-west-trending lensoid zones of faulting, brecciation and hydrothermal alteration. Just north of the intrusion, the zones were followed for a distance of 1500 m; widths of individual zones vary from 20 to 100 m. The zones tend to coalesce into much wider (up to 200 m) brecciated packages that dip steeply (70-85°) to the south and apparently crosscut the intrusive. A network of northerly dipping fault and alteration zones crosscut these breccias.
The breccias include intensive quartz stockwork and thicker quartz-filled shear zones containing disseminated gold-bearing sulphide (pyrite, arsenopyrite) mineralization. Rock samples returned numerous strongly anomalous gold values ranging from 200 ppb to 1.05 g/t throughout the extent of the breccia zones. Larger quartz veins locally exhibit much stronger sulphide enrichment, resulting in higher Ag, Bi, Sb, Pb, Zn and Cu values influencing property-scale geochemical zonation. A distinctive gold and pathfinder element soil anomaly is coincident with the breccia packages.
During the 2002 exploration program, the prospect was advanced to drill-ready stage. Proposed drilling will test subsurface continuation of gold-bearing fault/breccia and alteration zones into the intrusive rock.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Structural Geology,hydrothermal,mineral potential","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:40","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The mineralization is controlled by two district-scale fault zones and is especially intensive in the area of their intersection, located above and adjacent to the intrusive body. These larger structures host abundant gold-bearing massive and drusy quartz and chalcedony veins, zones of intense stockwork and strong brecciation, as well as numerous mineralized felsic dykes.
The gold grades within the mineralized structures are commonly in the range of 200 ppb to 2.0-3.0 g/t Au, with higher (up to 16 g/t Au) values attributed to the fault intersection area. Multi-staged gold mineralization found in the quartz veins, stockwork and altered dykes is associated with sulphide minerals (mainly pyrite and arsenopyrite) and elevated As, Bi and Ag values. A later mineralizing episode produced sulphide mineral-bearing chalcedony and drusy quartz veins, with gold concentrations accompanied by elevated Sb, Hg, Ag and Pb values, indicating the affi nity of epithermal style gold mineralization.

Two sampling teams collected 331 till samples, including regional and deposit orientation samples from Wolverine, Kudz Ze Kayah and the Argus properties. In total, 489 till samples were analysed by ICP-MS, including 158 samples collected in 2000. Quaternary exposures were logged and interpreted in order to reconstruct the Late Wisconsinan glacial history of the area (McConnell Glaciation). Ice-flow patterns during glacial maximum generally trended towards the west-northwest. Basal till is widespread across plateau surfaces and glaciofluvial sand and gravel dominate in low-lying terrain. Multi-element anomalies are present near known mineralized zones. High lead and zinc concentrations are measured in till down-ice from the massive sulphide bedrock mineralization at Kudz Ze Kayah. In addition, multi-element anomalies particularly enriched in base metals are found northwest of Wolverine Lake and southwest of Finlayson Lake, where no mineral occurrences are known.

Results of the 2000 survey indicated the presence of a multi-element anomaly suggestive of epithermal mineralization in the northwest corner of the study area. Staking has ensued in the area. Follow-up sampling on the anomaly confirmed the 2000 results and has yielded highly anomalous gold levels. Another sample collected south (up-ice) from the Kudz Ze Kayah deposit returned an unexpected high gold concentration.

The Yukon and Canadian governments and Kluane and White River First Nations agreed to create a SMA, to be designated as a Habitat Protection Area, which covers Pickhandle Lake and the surrounding wetlands. The Habit Protection Area designation does not require the withdrawal of the area from mineral staking and withdrawal has not been requested in the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Governments of Canada, Yukon and the First Nations. The purpose of this report is to present the results of the detailed mineral assessment of an approximately 281.7 km2 area that encompassed the proposed Special Management Area. This enlarged area was included to provide some relative context for the assessment. The proposed SMA area has no known mineral occurrences and fieldwork conducted during 2002 did not identify any mineral resources. As the proposed SMA is a wetland in the overburden covered Shakwak Trench no rock exposures were found within the SMA in 2002 and conventional soil and stream sediment sampling were determined to be ineffective. The detailed mineral assessment is based on the mineral potential of the geology as identified by a panel of industry experts. The resulting detailed mineral potential map indicates that the belt of Wrangellia Terrane rocks, on the southwest side of proposed SMA, have the highest relative mineral potential. Due to insufficient information the detailed assessment panel did not establish any applicable potential mineral deposit models for the proposed SMA area. This resulted in the tract containing the proposed SMA having the lowest relative mineral potential. The assessment panel determined that the Wrangellia Terrane has potential for hosting gabbroic nickel-copper, volcanic massive sulfide volcanogenic type, gold-quartz vein and copper skarn deposits. The Nasina Assemblage rocks on the north east side of the SMA were considered to have potential for hosting gabbroic nickel - copper, volcanic massive sulfide Besshi/Cyprus and gold-quartz vein deposits. Field work in 2002 located outcrops with anomalous gold, arsenic and antimony values in quartz veins in the tract bounding the northeast side of the proposed SMA.

These results provide baseline pedological and soil-geomorphological descriptions for the Klondike Plateau, which will assist future biophysical mapping and contribute to our understanding of landscape evolution. Results pertaining to soil geochemistry provide landscape related
guidelines for mineral exploration. For example, the stratigraphic distribution of loess within soil profiles is described according to slope aspect. This allows the explorationist to design sampling procedures that are more likely to detect geochemical anomalies in the underlying bedrock. Soil geochemical variations in colluvium are shown to reflect upslope variations in bedrock lithology.

42992,"information","Enhancing Natural Succession on Yukon Mine Tailings Sites: A low-input Management Approach","The revegetation of northern tailings sites presents many challenges. By using plants, which are naturally adapted to both the tailings environment and northern climatic conditions, fewer amendments and intervention will be required. In 2003, vegetation growing on and off the tailings and soil at three Yukon Territory, Canada, mine sites (United Keno Hill, Mount Skukum, and Wellgreen) was assessed and soil samples were collected. Through Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), a statistical program that assesses relationships between plant species and environmental variables, I found that these plant communities are largely governed by a chemical-nutrient gradient (heavy metals and nutrients) and a ground cover gradient (bare and exposed conditions compared with full ground cover). The native grass Deschampsia caespitosa L. Beauv. was found colonizing all three tailings sites and its presence was associated with low nutrients, high heavy metal levels, and exposed ground, but it was also a habitat generalist. Five Yukon populations of D. caespitosa, originating from mine and uncontaminated sites were tested hydroponically for their tolerance to elevated Ni, Zn, and Cd concentrations.  Intrinsic multiple metal tolerance occurred in all populations. In revegetation field trials in the Yukon, I planted seeds and transplants of 7 populations of D. caespitosa under different treatments: i) untreated, ii) compost, iii) fertilizer, and iv) combined (compost and fertilizer). At all sites, during the two years of data collection, local and non-local populations, including those from non-contaminated sites were able to establish, grow, and reproduce, even in unamended tailings and despite successive hot and dry summers. D. caespitosa also acted as a nurse crop, facilitating invasion of plants from adjacent habitats. The short term results suggest that the inclusion of Deschampsia caespitosa as a nurse crop for the revegetation of these northern mine tailings sites will be beneficial.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:40","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42993,"information","Heavy Metals and Acid Rock Drainage: A Select Literature Review of Remediation and Recommendations for Applied Research","EBA Engineering Consultants Ltd. has prepared this report, based on literature review, to provide information to assist the Yukon mining industry in remediating environmental problems caused by acid rock drainage (ARD) with its associated heavy metals contamination. There are three main sections to this review. First, the history of ARD is presented. Second, the chemistry and microbiology of ARD and the treatments that are used worldwide, with emphasis on cold climate treatments, are reviewed. Finally, we present the most promising technologies developed in temperate regions, that could be tested under typical Yukon conditions. This is the main challenge given the short growing season and cold temperatures.

Acid mine drainage is caused by oxidization of metal ores, containing sulphur and metal sulfides found in coal. There are three steps in this process. First, oxygenated water, from rain, for example, oxidizes metal sulfides producing acidic water and ferrous iron. When the water becomes moderately acidic, a number of bacteria can assist in further oxidization and increase the acidification of the drainage water. Finally, when the water reaches a pH of 3.5, an iron bacterium, Thiobacillus ferroxidans, can further dissolve metal sulfides, such as pyrite, producing ferric hydroxide, which can smother vegetation. Also, the sulphuric acid is acutely toxic. Heavy metals that are toxic, are also present in the ARD. Some common treatments for ARD identified by EBA including neutralizing the acidity of water using limestones, minimizing water contact with metal sulfides, or using organic amendments to bind with heavy metal contaminated waters. Important developments in using natural wetlands for ARD, have taken place in the late 1990s, which have identified that anaerobic (oxygen free conditions) are important in treating ARD. High sediment loads in streams have been found to limit neutralization by coating carbonates and decreasing microbial reduction of metal, as well as preventing metal uptake by vegetation.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:40","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
42994,"information","Reconnaissance Survey of Erosion Site at Gold Run Creek","Disturbance of frozen ground, through placer mining activities, may lead to slope failure. A stockpile of frozen overburden has recently begun eroding from the formation of a runoff channel. A large cut, approximately 300 metres long and up to 50 metres deep has been created adjacent to Gold Run Creek, a heavily mined area southeast of Dawson City.

This stockpiled overburden has been in place for several years and has revegetated with several species of mature willows (age dated to 15 years). Either due to heavy rainfall or climate change, melting has commenced in the stockpile resulting in the formation of a runoff channel. This has increased in size and slope failure continues to enlarge the cut.

Laberge Environmental Services conducted a reconnaissance survey of the site in July 2003, to assess the site with the purpose of exploring ways of halting the slope failure and stabilizing the disturbed section of overburden. Several bioengineering techniques have been suggested to assist in controlling the erosion.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:41","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The JLF is composed of carbonaceous shale and ripple cross-laminated calcareous sandstone thought to be associated with the Cordilleran miogeocline, and is devoid of sediment sourced from terranes to the west. Whole-rock shale geochemistry has provided evidence that the JLF is distinguishable from the underlying Mount Christie Formation and has trace and rare earth element concentrations that are most similar to old continental crust.

The Laberge Group (Lower-Middle Jurassic), informally subdivided into the Richthofen, Tanglefoot and Nordenskiold formations, was deposited in the Laberge basin, a collapsing fore-arc basin in which the arc was undergoing uplift and erosion. The Richthofen formation consists of conglomerate, massive sandstone, sandstone-mudstone couplets, volcaniclastic rocks and minor limestone interpreted as submarine fan systems.

43046,"information","Glacial history of Howard’s Pass and applications to drift prospecting.","Four stages of ice-flow occurred in Howard’s Pass during the late Wisconsinan McConnell glaciation. The first stage is marked by ice growth from local cirques. During the second stage, an ice divide developed east of the Nahanni River, with ice flowing southwest across Howard’s Pass. Ice sheet growth continued during stage 3 and the ice divide migrated southwest into the Logan Mountains. At this time ice flowed northward across the study area. Stage 4 is marked by deglaciation and more topographically influenced ice-flow. This last phase of ice-flow is the most important for drift prospecting in the valley bottoms. Conversely, drift transport directions at higher elevation are likely remnant from earlier stages of ice-flow. A mobile-metal-ion survey over a known deposit returned promising results, supporting the potential of this geochemical technique in other drift-covered areas of Howard’s Pass.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,McConnell glaciation,geochemistry","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:41","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

43058,"information","Natural Sources of Contaminants in the Yukon","This study investigated background levels and uptake rates of organophilic metals, particularly selenium, in ten streams draining portions of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane and Cassiar Platform between Ross River and Watson Lake, Yukon. The study area is suspected to have elevated background metals concentrations and is of interest for mineral exploration and development due to high mineralization. Information on natural metals levels is lacking for this region and for the Yukon in general. Water, sediments, benthic invertebrates and fish (slimy sculpin; Cottus cognatus) were sampled and analyzed for metals concentrations. Benthic invertebrates were identified to genus and percent composition of each species in each stream was calculated. The lack of anthropogenic activity in the area indicates that selenium concentrations found in all sample media and natural, background concentrations. Of all the sample media, concentrations of selenium were highest in sediment; however, sediment selenium concentrations were found to be in a range similar to levels documented at the Kudz Ze Kayah and Viceroy Brewery Creek mines in other regions of the Yukon.
Selenium concentrations in water generally exceeded CCME guidelines, but also fell within a range similar to the Kudz Ze Kayah and Viceroy Brewery Creek mines. These findings with respect to selenium levels in water and stream sediments highlight the importance of developing site-specific selenium guidelines for management of aquatic systems. The rate of uptake of selenium in benthic invertebrate and fish tissues was
greater than that of the other organophilic metals investigated. Selenium concentrations were generally higher in benthic invertebrates than in fish, likely owing to the detritus-feeding and bottom-dwelling life history of these invertebrates. Weak positive trends were noted in the relationship between selenium concentrations in fish and benthic invertebrates, and between fish and the water column. A significant positive relationship was noted between selenium concentrations in fish and stream sediments. These findings are consistent with past studies documenting dietary sources as the most common uptake pathways for selenium, with water comprising a secondary source. Examination of benthic invertebrate community composition revealed commonly abundant species and species typical of fast-flowing streams with high water quality, which is characteristic of the streams in the study area. The findings of this study provide valuable baseline information on background concentrations of metals, particularly selenium, as well as documentation of benthic invertebrate community composition, in an aquatic system that may experience resource development in the future.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:42","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
43059,"information","Interim Report on the Recent Deglacierization of the Wheaton River Watershed, YT","Over the past several decades, the rate of temperature increase in the Arctic has been twice that of the rest of the planet. Climate modeling suggests that this region will experience greater climate warming over the remainder of this century than other parts of the world. We are studying the effects of recent, rapid and significant warming on physical environments of southern Yukon Territory, which is within sub-Arctic Canada. In this paper, we document rapid glacier retreat in the Wheaton River watershed, which presently supports the only glaciers on southern Yukon Plateau. Our research involves study of the largest of the glaciers in the Wheaton watershed, hereafter referred to informally as “Wheaton Glacier”. It addresses three questions: How has Wheaton Glacier changed over the past century? What is the relationship between historic activity of the glacier and regional climate? What have been the effects of climate warming and glacier retreat on the watershed? Wheaton Glacier has shrunk in area by 41% since the first photographs of it were taken in 1948. Glacier retreat has accelerated in the past 40 years, and the glacier is now so thin and short that it may disappear within the next 20 years. The main cause of glacier thinning and retreat is an increase in mean temperature; average winter snowfall has gradually increased over the period of record. Warming and glacier recession are altering sediment delivery in the upper Wheaton River watershed. A pulse of sediment is moving downstream from the Wheaton Glacier forefield and affecting the fan at the mouth of the valley. Large, out-of-channel debris flows are spilling across the fan, aggrading and shifting the stream channel. Evidence from cores and ground-penetrating radar surveys suggest that debris flows have dominated sedimentation on the fan during the last half of the Holocene, coincident with Neoglacial advances culminating in the Little Ice Age and the period of rapid glacier retreat following the Little Ice Age. Triggers identified for some of the debris flows include the draining of a proglacial lake, a rockfall possibly caused by permafrost melt, increased sediment availability associated with glacier retreat; and rock glacier activity.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:42","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The Imperial Formation is well exposed in outcrop along the eastern flank of the Richardson Mountains, notably on Tetlit Creek and Trail River (NTS map sheet 106L). During the summer of 2008, detailed partial stratigraphic sections were measured on Tetlit Creek to record lithologic variation within the formation. In addition, samples were collected to establish the age of the strata and its source rock potential by means of palynological, geochemical and vitrinite reflectance analyses.

In the east Richardson Mountains, Imperial Formation strata can be informally subdivided into two parts. The lower is predominantly mudstone and siltstone while the upper part comprises sandstone and fine-grained siliciclastic rocks. Palynological analyses for this region have established that the Imperial Formation is late Frasnian to Famennian in age. Accompanying thermal alteration indices (T.A.I.), as well as vitrinite reflectance data, suggest that the strata are overmature with respect to hydrocarbon generation. Based on Rock Eval/TOC results from surface, most of the organic matter present within the strata are not favourable for source rock potential.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,hydrocarbon,stratigraphy","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:42","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Polymetallic mineralization occurring in the Tinta zone predates trachytic dykes (~109 Ma) and represents the earliest phase of mineralization recognized on the Freegold Mountain property thus far. Feldspar porphyry dykes that intrude the Revenue zone are correlative to the Nucleus zone feldspar porphyry dykes, and yield ages of ~105-104 Ma, indicating that the structural corridor in which Au mineralization occurred was active from at least this time. Furthermore, monzodiorite was emplaced at ~107 Ma within the Revenue zone. An ~97 Ma aplitic dyke that intrudes porphyritic granite of the Stoddart intrusion predates ~94 Ma Mo-Cu-W mineralization. Andesitic dykes (~77 Ma) that crosscut the Stoddart porphyry and rhyolitic dykes (~75 Ma) intruding the Revenue zone, represent Carmacks-age volcanism in the region.

Unlike Keno Hill, veins on the McKay Hill property lack siderite gangue and are not present as vein-faults.

The Ag-Pb-Zn veins in the Keno Hill Camp were emplaced in discrete dilational fault structures within polydeformed clastic metasediments and are not associated with extensive alteration.

This information has important applications to surficial geochemical and placer exploration. The Quaternary geology of this area is unique because it encompasses early to middle Pleistocene (pre-Reid) glacial surfaces that are preserved beyond the limit of the Illinoian (Reid) glacial limit. These pre-Reid surfaces have been exposed to long periods of weathering and erosion, which have diminished their original distribution and expression. Stratigraphic exposures examined in the map area provide new evidence for a large glacial lake(s) in the Lake Creek basin (‘glacial lake Coldspring’); the lake developed when pre-Reid ice dammed outlets in the Willow Hills and lower Lake Creek. In addition, there is evidence that another large glacial lake (‘glacial lake Rosebud’) formed on the west side of the White Mountains when a pre-Reid glacier dammed Rosebud Creek. Fieldwork in the White Mountains and on Australia Mountain allowed us to delineate the pre-Reid glacial limit at approximately 1000 m (3300-3400 ft) a.s.l. This elevation is lower than the pre-Reid glacial limit previously mapped for the area by Duk-Rodkin (1999) and is consistent with mapping performed in the adjacent Stewart River map sheet by Bostock (1964), Jackson (2005a,b) and Froese and Jackson (2005).","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The grade of fine gold within gravel recovered from the southern Klondike was assessed using a combination of screening and bulk leaching by cyanidation. This approach eliminates the nugget effect and size ranges selected correspond to particle sizes exploitable by different metallurgical methods: <53 µm (cyanidation), 53-125 µm (‘enhanced g’ concentrators), 125-500 µm (sluice boxes). Colluvium, virgin gravel and tailings from various mining operations were collected from a relatively long drainage where accumulation of fine gold could feasibly occur. In all samples, gold <125 µm was negligible. Despite this negative result, this approach to resource evaluation is straightforward and could be applied advantageously in other areas where source mineralization contains fine gold.

Gold-bearing sulphide mineralization is peripheral to a zone of hornfels and local tungsten-bearing skarn that is associated with several small bodies of granitic aplite and pegmatite that have yielded 40Ar/39Ar muscovite ages of 62.3 ± 0.7 Ma, 62.4 ± 1.8 Ma and 59.1 ± 2.0 Ma. These intrusions are geochemically different and slightly younger than the 65.2 ± 2.0 Ma McQuesten plutonic suite farther to the south. Most Pb isotopic analyses of sulphides from the Rau deposit cluster within compositions of igneous feldspars from the associated intrusions; however, some analyses fall on a trend toward more radiogenic compositions that were determined for the host carbonate rocks. The data are consistent with the Rau sulphide mineralization being genetically related to the early Paleocene felsic intrusions, and forming peripheral to more proximal zones of hornfelsing and tungsten-bearing skarns.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Dawson thrust,Mackenzie platform,McQuesten plutonic suite,Rau deposit,carbonate rocks,mineralization,skarn","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate titanite as an indicator mineral for tungsten-skarn mineralization. Titanite from samples of scheelite mineralization from the Risby, Ray Gulch and Mactung deposits was analysed by electron microprobe. The titanite is fluorine-rich and some grains contain anomalous tin, but in most grains metal concentrations are at or below the detection limits of the microprobe (~20-50 ppm). Future work is planned to analyze titanite by LA ICP-MS to determine, in particular, the W-Mo-Sn contents to further evaluate the use of titanite as an indicator mineral for W skarn exploration.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Mactung,Ray Gulch,electron microprobe","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

These descriptions provide the basis for correlation with Proterozoic strata of adjacent inliers in eastern Alaska, as well as in the eastern Ogilvie Mountains.
The lowest unit contains interbedded limestone and mudstone with distinctive maroon-weathering layers. Similar strata are present in unit D of the Pinguicula Group exposed in the Hart River inlier. In that area however, the middle sequence containing massive dolostone, that is the most prominent unit of the upper Fifteenmile Group, is missing beneath an angular unconformity. The Callison Lake dolostone is above this surface and is lithologically indistinguishable from the uppermost, stromatolitic carbonate of the upper Fifteenmile Group. Both the middle and upper dolostone units are preceded by black shale, indicating abrupt transgressions. In contrast, the carbonate units contain abundant evidence of shallow water and periodic emergence.

43120,"information","Structural controls on hydrothermal gold mineralization in the White River area, Yukon","New mapping and drilling associated with gold exploration has elucidated the structural and lithological controls on hydrothermal gold systems in the White River area. The Paleozoic basement consists of a sequence of amphibolite facies clastic metasedimentary and meta-igneous rocks that host lower grade ultramafic rocks, some magmatically and some tectonically emplaced during the Late Triassic – Early Jurassic. Mapped ultramafic bodies show close congruence with published airborne magnetic anomalies. All of these rocks are cut by brittle normal faults and fractures, and dykes correlated with middle Cretaceous to early Tertiary extension-related intrusive rocks. Gold mineralization associated with these fractures is strongly controlled by host rock types. Two main rock types, felsic gneiss and quartzite, are preferentially fractured and hydrothermally altered. Other rock types are only weakly fractured and locally altered. In particular, ultramafic bodies and micaceous lithologies locally impeded fluid flow.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Structural Geology,White River","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The strata were deposited with angular unconformity on the Wernecke Supergroup following the Racklan orogeny and emplacement of the Hart River sills. Two contact relationships have been resolved in the 2009 field season. The first, a 1.38 Ga dike previously thought to crosscut unit A, has instead been recognized to crosscut the underlying Wernecke Supergroup strata. This relationship is significant because it once again places the lower age limit of the Pinguicula Group into question and may reposition the Pinguicula Group within the history of geologic events. Secondly, the previously undefined contact relationship between units B and C has been identified as a gradational contact confirming the placement of unit C within the Pinguicula Group. In addition, preliminary data collected from the western Ogilvie Mountains draws similarities between units PR1 and PR2 of the lower Fifteenmile Group and units A, B and C of the Pinguicula Group.

Sediment cores were sampled from seven lakes located within the plume of the eastern lobe of the White River Ash (1147 cal. years BP). Site locations are between 92 and 254 km from Mount Churchill, Alaska, the probable source for the White River Ash. Based on magnetic susceptibility measurements, the depth of the sediment above the ash layer in the lakes ranges between 38 and 98 cm; these differences are due to factors associated with sedimentation rates. The thickness of the ash ranges between 0.1 and 32 cm and typically increases with proximity to the source vent. These results can be used in paleoenvironmental studies to assist in the interpretation of the impact of volcanic ash events.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Mount Churchill,paleoenvironment,sedimentation rates","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

In an undisturbed forest, the base of the modern active layer is stable with a suspended ice/sediment cryofacies at the contact. A recently burned site (2004) shows that the degrading contact has not yet stabilized. An earlier disturbance from the 1970s shows evidence of aggradation (upward shift) of the permafrost table following limited vegetation succession. Underlying all three sites is an older disturbance corresponding to a thaw depth of ~2 m, predating the 1970s disturbance; it is likely that this represents an early 20th century disturbance associated with the deforestation of the valley during the gold rush era. Permafrost has recovered significantly since that time as the boreal forest and understory vegetation was re-established, underscoring the role of vegetation cover in permafrost disturbance and recovery.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Our research involves the study of the Wheaton glacier, the largest of the glaciers in the Wheaton River watershed. Since the Little Ice Age, the Wheaton glacier has lost 50% of its area and 58 to 63% of its volume. Thinning and retreat have accelerated in the past 40 years and the glacier is now so thin and short that it may disappear during this century. This loss was quantified through the analysis of sequential aerial photography and bivariate scaling analysis. Observations in the climate record from 1907 to 2005 have shown an increase in mean atmospheric temperature, as well as an increase in average winter snowfall. Despite increasing winter snowfall, changes in temperature continue to be the main cause of the persistent negative mass balance of the Wheaton glacier. If air temperatures continue to rise and glaciers disappear from the Wheaton River watershed, discharges and timing of peak flow events of the Wheaton River will be affected.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Coast Mountains,Wheaton glacier","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Minto copper sulphides are hosted in sheet-like expanses of biotite-rich, variably deformed granitoids surrounded by massive granodiorite. Attempts to explain Minto’s unusual mineralization style have ranged from digested red-bed copper, to aborted and deformed porphyry, and recently to an Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) type system. Although these commonly used genetic frameworks can explain many aspects of Minto-style mineralization, questions regarding chemistry, paragenesis, and structural controls on mineralization still remain. This paper is part of an MSc thesis project that will focus on characterizing mineral textures, mineral chemistry, mineral paragenesis and micro and macro structural analyses to improve our understanding of the Minto copper-gold mineralized system and to enhance regional exploration potential in the district.

For this study, in total, 226 rock samples collected from outcrop and drill core throughout the Bonnet Plume Basin were analyzed by Rock-Eval 6 programmed pyrolysis and combustion to assess the petroleum source-rock potential of the strata. The results indicate that the Road River Formation (Cambrian to Devonian) has no source rock potential, but the Bonnet Plume Formation (Cretaceous to Tertiary) has gas and perhaps oil potential. Potential oil generation in the Bonnet Plume Formation is attributed to the occurrence of liptinite-bearing coal and previously unrecognized, siliceous, oil shale.

U-Pb zircon age determinations for felsic meta-volcanic rocks of the White River formation and gabbro intrusions are Late Devonian and late Middle Triassic respectively. These new age determinations substantiate the proposed correlation of these components of ‘Windy-McKinley’ terrane with the succession on strike to the northwest which hosts the volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits in the Delta District, Alaska. Trace-element geochemical data from Triassic gabbro intrusions into the Mirror Creek and White River formations, and diabase and gabbro of the Harzburgite Peak-Eikland Mountain ophiolite suggest that magmatism in both subdivisions occurred in supra-subduction zone settings.

The Sheep Creek succession contains extensive carbonate horizons and is likely part of the Cassiar terrane. To the west, metaclastic rocks of the Scurvy Creek succession are extensively intruded by sills and dykes composed of augen meta-granite of Early Mississippian age; they are correlated with the Snowcap assemblage of Yukon-Tanana terrane. The overlying Dycer Creek succession in the southwest comprises marble, carbonaceous rocks, greenstone and quartzite of Lower Mississippian (and younger?) age that probably correlate with the Finlayson assemblage of Yukon-Tanana terrane. The ‘Mendocina Creek’ area experienced at least four phases of deformation and greenschist- to amphibolite-facies metamorphism.

As part of this project, Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) and Northern Cross (Yukon) Limited (NCY) are collaborating with the GSC to assess shale gas potential of Devonian shale at Eagle Plain.

Diamond drill core was retrieved from mineral exploration properties to evaluate shale gas potential of Devonian shale of Road River Group and Canol and Imperial formations. Diamond drill core from four holes, located on the Rich property east of Eagle Plain Hotel, were examined and sampled. The core was systematically sampled and analysed by Rock-Eval pyrolysis, optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) mineralogy, and palynology.

The results indicate that the succession is thermally overmature with respect to hydrocarbon generation. Due to the high levels of thermal maturity, the Rock-Eval data are unreliable. However, high amounts of residual organic carbon suggest that the Canol Formation has the potential to be an important source rock in the region, under favourable burial conditions. The very high level of thermal maturity of the strata also resulted in very few identifiable Palynomorphs; however, Canol and Imperial formation samples yielded dates of Middle to Late Devonian and Frasnian to Famennian, respectively. XRD analyses indicate Canol Formation shale is highly siliceous whereas Road River Group shale and silty shale of the Imperial Formation are less siliceous and exhibit a more varied lithology. This study suggests that the Canol Formation is more prospective for shale gas than strata of the Imperial Formation or Road River Group.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Canol Formation,Imperial formation,Road River Group,shale gas potential,stratigraphy","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The use of soil augers to penetrate through loess-rich units and into locally derived weathered bedrock has been important in the successful application of this technique. To assist the mineral exploration industry, we characterized the surficial geology, soils and permafrost of the northern Dawson Range. Mapping indicated that widespread loess is present in the study area and the thickest deposits are located in basins on the south side of the Dawson Range near the Donjek and White rivers. A mantle of weathered bedrock covers virtually the entire landscape. The texture of fluvial deposits is affected by stream order and base level changes along the Yukon River. By understanding the effects of slope, aspect, elevation and permafrost processes on surficial materials, a landscape model can be developed that will facilitate geochemical exploration and mineral development in the region.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Mineral Exploration,fluvial deposit,soil geochemistry","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

A total of eleven sections were examined on both the east and west banks of the Yukon River. Representative stratigraphic units were analysed for grain size distribution; deposits ranged in size from silt and clay to coarse gravel. Most of the observed sediments represent the glaciolacustrine depositional environment of Glacial Lake Laberge with the exception of a loess unit exposed near the top of the sections. Consistency indices of seven silt and clay-rich samples collected in the bluffs surrounding Whitehorse indicate a low plasticity comparable with other Canadian loess units and the glaciolacustrine bluffs around Kamloops and in the Elk Valley of British Columbia. The soil unconfined compressive strength was estimated using a pocket penetrometer and the dry silt and clay-rich units were found to have strength estimates up to two orders of magnitude greater than the sand-rich units.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,glacial lake laberge,stratigraphy","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

43868,"information","Geology of the Spearhead Mountain Stock, Sheldon Lake Map sheet, Yukon Territory","A two square mile stock of biotite quartz monzonite forms the core of Spearhead Mountain. The stock has intruded Ordovician and Silurian sediments and has thermalIy altered them for a distance of up to one quarter mile. Mineralizing fluids ascended near vertical cooling fractures in the quartz monzonite, creating a porphyry copper deposit of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite.

Trend surfaces from the first to the third order were established from plagioclase, orthoclase, quartz and total mafic minerals modal data and specific gravity values for the intrusive rock. Quartz, total mafic minerals and specific gravity vary systematically while orthoclase and plagioclase have erratic distributions. Contoured modal data and second degree trend surfaces for quartz, specific gravity and total mafic minerals show a circular distribution pattern. Linear trend surfaces indicate northwesterly and southeasterly gradients for quartz, plagioclase, orthoclase and specific gravity.

The original homogeneous granitic magma was contaminated by silica assimilation of the intruded, highly siliceous sediments. Incomplete diffusion of the contaminating silica Iead to a circular outward increase in silica and a corresponding outward decrease in mafic minerals, but did not significantly affect the distribution of orthoclase or plagioclase. The circular zonation of the high specific gravity mafic minerals gave rise to a similar zonation of specific gravities.

43890,"information","Genesis of the Blende Carbonate hosted ZN-Pb-Ag deposit, north central Yukon Territory: Geologic, fluid inclusion and isotopic constraints","The Blende zinc-lead-silver deposit, 60 km northeast of Keno City, Yukon Territory, is spatially associated with a mid-Proterozoic fault zone that crosscuts stromatolitic dolostones of the Middle Proterozoic, upper Gillespie Lake Group. It is the largest known strata-bound, carbonate-hosted, zinc-lead deposit in the Yukon Territory. Mineralization, largely epigenetic, consists of sphalerite and galena, with lesser pyrite and chalcopyrite, and trace friebergite in quartz-carbonate veins and veinlets. Veining is zoned from copper- and silver-rich mineralization at the base of the deposit, through lead- and zinc-rich, to zinc-dominated at the top. Detailed cross-section mapping indicates that controls on the deposit are both stratigraphic and structural. Many of the stromatolite beds are mineralized and are especially rich in lead and zinc close to normal faults. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that mineralizing fluids were about 285 degrees C during main-stage mineralization. Sulfur isotope analyses of unmineralized whole-rock samples cluster tightly around an average delta 34 S value of 23.6 + or - 0.4 per mil. The source of sulfur is apparently seawater sulfate, probably from minor anhydrite in the host dolostone. Sulfide sulfur isotope ratios define three populations. Local blebs of pyrite associated with stromatolites have markedly negative ratios (- 15.1%) that are probably bacteriogenic in origin. Vein sulfides in tight dololutites have ratios between 19.0 and 26.3 per mil, with an average delta 34 S value of 23.2 PM 0.9 per mil. This is virtually identical to the whole-rock sulfur isotope ratio. Veins that crosscut stromatolitic beds have sulfur isotope ratios between 18.3 and 7.4 per mil with a mean of 15.0 + or - 1.2 per mil. Intermediate sulfur isotope ratios apparently reflect a mixed sulfur source of both whole-rock sulfate and biogenic sulfide. Carbon and oxygen isotopes in host rocks and ore-stage dolomite spar are related genetically; both are related to ancient seawater. The calculated isotopes for mineralizing fluids are characteristic of basinal brines...

44018,"information","Geologic setting and petrology of the Proterozoic Ogilvie Mountains breccia of the Coal Creek inlier, southern Ogilvie Mountains, Yukon Territory","Ogilvie Mountains breccia (OMB) is in Early (?) to Late Proterozoic rocks of the Coal Creek Inlier, southern Ogilvie Mountains, Yukon. Host rocks are the Wernecke Supergroup (Fairchild Lake, Quartet and Gillespie Lake groups) and lower Fifteenmile group. Ogilvie Mountains breccia crops out discontinuously along two east-trending belts called the Northern Breccia Belt (NBB) and the Southern Breccia Belt (SBB). Individual bodies of OMB vary from dike and sill-like to pod-like. The NBB coincides with a north side down reverse fault—an inferred ruptured anticline—called the Monster fault. The SBB coincides with a north side down fault called the Fifteenmile fault. The age of OMB is constrained by field relationships and galena lead isotope data. The age of OMB formation is between 1.45 and 0.90 Ga.

Hydrothermal alteration has locally overprinted OMB and introduced silica, hematite and sulphide minerals. Rare earth element chemistry reflects a lack of mantle or deep-seated igneous process in the formation of OMB. However, this may be only an apparent lack because flooding by a large volume of sedimentary material could obscure a REE pattern indicative of another source.

44029,"information","The geology and mineralogy of the Brown McDade Mine","The Brown McDade Mine is a gold-silver discovery in Yukon, halfway between Whitehorse and Dawson. It lies in the area unglaciated during the Pleistocene Period. Diamond drilling and stripping in 1946 indicated commercial values across a width of 10 feet and over a length of 1000 ft. The geologic structure is that of a Late Tertiary, dike-like body of quartz feldspar porphyry cutting quartz diorite of Jurassic or later age. This body has a Northwest strike and dips steeply west. The ore zone lies in the porphyry and is believed genetically related to it. The mineralization consists of a cherry-like fine grained blue quartz, with disseminated sulphides comprising less than 5% of the mass. Metallic minerals are pyrite, arsenopyrite, and sphalerite, with lesser amounts of galena, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, stibnite, bournonite, jamesonite and gold. The gold is associated with the pyrite in fine particles, the majority less than 150 microns in size. The gold-silver ratio is about one to ten. Sericitization and carbonatization are the chief forms of hydrothermal alteration, while considerable limonite, and around the ore zone, jarosite, have been produced by weathering. On the basis of comparisons with known deposits, the Brown McDade is considered to belong to the deeper epithermal type. It should continue to reasonable depths although the ore shoots are likely to be erratic. The area south of the main ore zone, underlain by schistose rocks will probably be unfavorable for the occurrence of ore.

Placer gold within the study area is known to originate from at least two main local lode sources: 1) gold in sheeted quartz veins within a Late Cretaceous-age granodiorite stock; and 2) gold in isolated quartz-sulphide fissure veins found in bedrock along Haggart Creek. Placer gold is believed to have formed as a result of reworking and re-concentration of gold during interglacial times, as well as reworking of older auriferous interglacial gravel by McConnell-age periglacial alluvium. The primary setting for placer gold deposits is Late McConnell to Early Holocene alluvium, on or near bedrock. Sub-crystalline to crystalline placer gold grains recovered from sediments found far removed from currently known local bedrock sources suggests that other lode sources may be present within the study area.

46727,"information","Volcanic evidence for a compositional contrast in the lithospheric upper mantle across the Tintina Trench, southeastern Yukon, Canada","In the southeastern Yukon Territory, Quaternary continental alkaline basalts have erupted across an important crustal suture, the Tintina Trench, which separates the accreted terranes of the Canadian Cordillera from the ancestral North American craton. The lavas from the Rancheria region from the west side of the Tintina Trench are basanites (BASAN), alkaline olivine basalts (AOB), and hypersthene-normative basalts (HYN). They display fractionated rare earth element (REE) profiles and are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE) and high field strength elements (HFSE). The compositional spectra of the Rancheria alkaline magmas appears to represent the progressive melting of an amphibole-bearing garnet lherzolite. The involvement of amphibole in the petrogenesis of the Rancheria alkaline magmas indicates that these magmas were generated within the lithosphere. At the eastern end of the Rancheria suite, on the east side of the Tintina Trench, the AOB from Watson Lake have higher Zr contents than Rancheria AOB to the west of the Trench. The high Zr contents of the Watson Lake AOB are similar to those observed in the Hoole Eocene tholeiitic basalts, on the east side of the Tintina Trench, further to the north. The Eocene basalts from the Hoole River region are olivine tholeiites which have experienced closed-system crystal fractionation of olivine at low pressure. The estimated primary magma for these Eocene basalts appears to have been derived by partial melting of an incompatible-element enriched lithospheric mantle source, during which garnet was not a residual phase. The Nb-Zr systematics of the Watson Lake basalts indicate that they may be derived by mixing between melts produced by melting of an amphibole-bearing residue and a lithospheric mantle similar in composition to that of the Hoole basalts. Therefore, these compositional differences in the alkaline basalts across the Tintina Trench appear to reflect the juxtaposition of chemically distinct continental lithospheric mantles, indicating that the Tintina Fault is a steep lithospheric suture.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:02","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

47049,"information","The deforming bed beneath a surge-type glacier; measurement of mechanical and electrical properties","Glacier surging is a flow instability characterized by short periods of rapid glacier flow separating longer periods of normal flow. It is accepted that sustained high sub-glacial water pressure causes glacier surging by decoupling the glacier from its bed, but how this high subglacial water pressure is developed and sustained is the subject of debate. The current focus of glaciological research is on the interaction of subglacial processes with the subglacial drainage system. We have developed new investigative techniques for exploring two subglacial processes: basal deformation and electrical phenomena. These techniques have been plied in research undertaken on Trapridge Glacier, a small surge-type glacier in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada; these are the first in situ measurements of deformation, electrical resistivity, and streaming potentials beneath a surge-type glacier. The development of a reliable theological description of subglacial material required field observations of its stress-strain response; this was the motivation for our subglacial deformation experiments. We have demonstrated that no clear relationship exists between values of shear stress and effective pressure calculated using accepted methods and deformation rate; the absence of an expected relationship suggests that alternate methods for quantifying subglacial shear stress and effective pressure need to be found. Data from our subglacial electrical resistivity measurements and from the deformation measurements provide strong evidence that the distribution of normal and shear loading at the glacier bed is not even and that subglacial deformation rates can be affected by distant changes in subglacial pressure conditions. We have also observed temporal changes in electrical flow paths within subglacial sediments. We have shown that temporal variations in natural potential observed beneath Trapridge Glacier are caused by streaming potentials; streaming potentials result from cross-coupling between fluid flow and electric currents. Our data suggest that inexpensive subglacial electrode arrays may be used to supplement pressure sensors.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:08","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Mass balance calculations suggest that these compositional differences are due to different  fractionation paths; a conclusion consistent with the observed mineral abundances near the glasses. Pearce Element Ratios show that at  least one of the lava flows sampled is not comagmatic with the others. Thermodynnmic modeling of silicate melts and textural  observations indicate that the pressure-temperature path of fractionation was polybaric, and that the minimum depth of melt separation  from the source rocks was 60 km. The volcanic rocks host dunite and lherzolite nodules consisting of diopside and hypersthene, olivine  and chromian spinel. Deformation textures and mineral compositions are different from other occurrences in western North America.  Geothermometry on the xenoliths provide temperature estimates between 930°C and 1350°C.

48334,"information","The mineralogy and geochemistry of polymetallic mineral deposits at the Ketza River gold mine, Pelly Mountains, central Yukon Territory","The Ketza River polymetallic mineral deposits are situated in the Pelly Mountains, Central Yukon Territory. The deposits were mined  for gold from 1988 to 1990, producing 400 tomes of oxide ore per day over that period. The Ketza River deposits are hosted by lower  Paleozoic sedimentary strata of the parautochthonous Cassiar Terrane. The main host to economic mineralisation is a lower Cambrian,  massive, areheocyathid-bearing limestone, which outcrops over much of the Ketza River area. Four styles of mineralisation are  recognised within the Ketza River deposits. Type I mineralisation occurs in the centre of the area and consists of argillite-hosted, Au- quartz-sulphide veins. Sulphide mineralogy is mainly arsenopyrite and pyrite. Type II mineralisation consists of limestone-hosted, massive  sulphide mantos and chimneys. The principal sulphide mineralogy of the mantos is pyrrhotite-arsenopyrite-pyrite-chalcopyrite, with quartz  and calcite gangue. Gold is present within the arsenopyrite and pyrite. Type III mineralisation consists of limestone-hosted, quartz-sulphide  veins and mantos. Mineralogy is similar to the Type II mineralisation, but contains a higher proportion of gangue. Type IV mineralisation  consists of Ag-Pb veins. These veins are hosted by a variety of lithologies and represent the outermost extent of Ketza River  mineralisation. Sulphide mineralogy is galena-sphalerite-pyrite, with siderite, calcite and quartz gangue. Oxidation of sulphides in parts of  the Ketza River area is deep and pervasive. Areas of oxidation show increased gold grade and were the focus for mining. Oxidation  occurs in the heavily fractured central area of the mineralisation, and along the Peel Fault, which extends from the centre of mineralisation  towards the east. Light stable isotope studies indicate that the main mineralising fluid was of meteoric origin (delta (18)Ofluid = 10 per mil,  delta Dfluid = -165 per mil). This fluid had evolved in delta (18)O by interaction with Cassiar Terrane rocks before mineralisation occured.  Fluid flow in the limestones was pervasive, and produced a large, approximately 75km(2), (18)O depletion halo around the deposits. The  later oxidising fluid was also of meteoric origin (delta (18)Ofluid = 18 per mil) but shows no evidence of interaction with the sedimentary  pile. Fluid inclusion microthermometry suggests that the temperature of formation of the deposit was around 325 degrees C, at pressures  above 600 bars. The mineralising fluid contained approximately 11 mole% CO2+ or -CH4, and 5 equivalent weight% NaCI.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:33","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

48443,"information","Post-glacial vegetation history of the Aishihik Basin and its vicinity, southwest Yukon Territory, Canada; a palynological perspective","Nine pollen profiles were obtained along a broad latitudinal transect extending from the Upper Nisling Valley to the Ittlemit Lake and  Bear Lakes areas in the southwest Yukon Territory. Radiocarbon dated fossil pollen records from these profiles provided evidence for the  reconstruction of postglacial environmental history of the area. Surficial samples combined to aid the interpretation of the fossil data.  Records of these sequences suggest that the post-glacial vegetation in the area exhibited a successional development. Immediately after  the deglaciation, the area was covered by a sparse herb dominated tundra assemblage. Betula glandulosa invaded the area at about  10,000 yr BP, which initiated the replacement of herbaceous tundra by a dwarf birch shrub-tundra. Picea glauca invaded the Upper Nisling  Valley in the northern part of the study area and the Ittlemit Lake Basin in the south at least around 9,000 yr BP, while 8,600 yr BP in the  central Aishihik Basin, marked the establishment of forest-tundra environment in the area. Significant rise of Picea pollen at 7,500-8,000 yr  BP in the north-central part of the study area indicate the establishment of a modern boreal forest, which is approximately 1,500-2,000  years earlier than that indicated by the Antifreeze Pond pollen diagram from the Snag area of the southwest Yukon. It is notable that the  pollen spectra of two lacustrine sediments suggest a phase change of lakes into marsh occurring around 5,000-6,000 yr BP in the area,  and change of bog conditions has also been recorded at almost the same time in the area. These events occurred simultaneously in the  area and probably reflect the change of climatic conditions, which might have led to the development of permafrost in the region. The  development of early post-glacial vegetation in the area exhibited an unstable pattern. This instability was primarily related to the  sequential invasion and migration of taxa from late-glacial refugia. Stable vegetation associations were established in the area as a result  of migrators reaching their limit of climatic tolerance during the middle Holocene. Post-glacial vegetation history in the Ittlemit Lake Basin  area seems to have exhibited a different pattern.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The development of open subalpine parkland vegetation in lowlands after 25 ka reflects slow cooling to glacial conditions. Assumptions about continuously cold and dry glacial conditions are tested and disputed. Between 18-19 ka, pollen, plant macrofossil and beetle evidence suggest relatively warm and moist conditions in the Fraser/Puget Lowlands. A tentative correlation can be inferred with the recently defined ""Hanging Lake thermal event"" around 18-22 ka in the unglaciated Yukon. Further work should be done to test this inference. Paleobotanical data suggest that increasing moisture, rather than increased cooling, was responsible for the late Vashon ice advance in the southwestern Cordillera. The controversy regarding the nature of the vegetation cover in eastern Beringia, north of the main Cordilleran ice sheet, is not yet settled, although evidence to date favours a complex mosaic of tundra and ""steppe-tundra"" plant communities supporting a greater diversity of grazing large mammals than exist in the area today.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:36","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Based on intensity and style of deformation of ultramafic bodies and country rocks it is suggested that the ultramafic rocks were emplaced probably during the Permian period. Tintina fault is a weak zone along which the alpine ultramafic bodies of Clinton Creek and probably some of the others along and close to the Tintina Trench were tectonically emplaced. These were later folded and metamorphosed with the country rocks. During latest Cretaceous-earliest Tertiary time the area was intruded by acid intrusive rocks. The youngest undeformed and fresh basalt is probably of Selkirk volcanics equivalent. Three prominent phases of deformation were delineated. Probably the oldest and most complex phase occurred during the Permian, along with the initial movement of the Tintina fault. Small, tight, isoclinal folds are characteristics of this phase. The structural trend is roughly parallel to the direction of the Tintina Trench. Due to later deformations changes in direction of fold axes of this phase is common. The second phase of deformation gave rise to large recumbent folds with southerly vergence. Third phase of deformation gave rise to antiform structure of regional scale.

The Porcupine and Snow Shoe ultramafic bodies are mined for chrysotile asbestos. A few other ultramafic bodies contain appreciable amount of chrysotile-fibre but not of adequate quantity to be mined. Most of the ultramafic bodies are sheared or massive, and are devoid of known chrysotile-fibre. Chrysotile-fibre bearing serpentinized ultramafic masses within argillite unit or at the contact of argillite and other units seem to carry ore grade or substantial amount of chrysotile-fibre. Evidence of Clinton Creek asbestos deposit mainly supports formation of chrysotile-fibre as fracture filling. Although evidence of fracture filling rather than replacement seems convincing and exists on a wide scale, a few evidence indicates replacement characteristics on minor scale. The main phase of mineralization is believed to occur at the end of Cretaceous when acid intrusive rocks intruded the vicinity of the Clinton Creek area. These intrusions could have provided warm aqueous solution to react with the existing serpentine along fractures. This resulted deposition of chrysotile-fibre in an essentially closed system. Analysis of isotopic dates of the Yukon Crystalline Plateau shows a distinct grouping of igneous activity at mid Cretaceous and latest Cretaceous time.

48520,"information","Upper Proterozoic-Lower Cambrian sedimentary rocks of the Mount Harper Group, Ogilvie Mountains, Yukon","In the Ogilvie Mountains, west-central Yukon, the upper Proterozoic to Lower Cambrian Mount Harper Group (informal name)  contains strata equivalent to both basal Windermere Supergroup and Lower Cambrian rocks in other areas of the North American  Cordillera. Strata of the Mount Harper group are directly time constrained: the basal Windermere equivalents by a ca. 750 Ma U-Pb age  from a volcanic complex which both conformably overlies and intertongues with the sedimentary rocks; the disconformably overlying units  by the presence of Lower Cambrian trace fossils. The lower Mount Harper Group (LMHG) unconformably overlies a thick succession of  dolostones informally named the Fifteenmile Group. A breccia layer is discontinuously preserved on the unconformity surface. This breccia  contains silcretes and calcretes that record several episodes of subaerial exposure. Rare interbedded debris flows suggest that the most  recent of these episodes was coincident with initial deposition of the LMHG conglomerates. Silcretes and calcretes in this succession  suggest that, at the onset of Windermere deposition in this area, a temperate to equatorial, probably semi-arid to arid climate regime  prevailed. Elsewhere, basal breccias in Windermere-equivalent strata generally have been interpreted as fault-related, but some contain  features compatible with a karstic origin. A synsedimentary normal fault forms the southern margin of an asymmetric, east-trending half- graben basin which contains the lower Mount Harper Group. Basin fill appears to have been derived exclusively from source areas to the  south. Proximal facies consist of fault-talus breccia and up to 1100 m of debris-flow conglomerates that were deposited in coalescing  alluvial fans. Intermediate and distal facies include mid-to-lower fan conglomerates and sandstones deposited by sheetfloods, distal debris  flows and braided channel streamflows. A basin-fill coarsening-upward megasequence in the eastern part of thc study area records a  change from lacustrine redbeds to lower alluvial fan sandstones and conglomerates. The LMHG half-graben basin was formed, and  sedimentation was controlled, by normal faulting along the southern margin. Synsedimentary faulting and minor back-stepping of the fault  controlled development of the internal sequences. Volcanism conformably postdates this sedimentation, but northerly derived coarse  clastic rocks of the upper Mount Harper group (UMHG) .","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

48888,"information","Digital impulse radar for glaciology; instrumentation, modelling, and field studies","Several aspects of impulse radar echo sounding of small glaciers are investigated. First, the ranges of values expected for conductivity and relative dielectric permitivity of glacier ice, glacier bed materials and mixtures of ice and rock are established. These parameters, and the fundamentals of electromagnetic wave propagation, are employed in a modelling scheme that examines the reflection of pulses from planar reflectors within the glacier. The glacier bed can be modelled as solid rock or unconsolidated debris and as either frozen or wet. A layer of mixed ice and rock between the glacier ice and bed can also be included. Signal enhancement, especially using multi-channel principal component analysis, is discussed. Discussion of practical application of the technique begins with the description of a portable microprocessor-controlled instrument capable of recording digitized echograms. Then results from experiments on Trapridge Glacier, Yukon are presented. Surveys up to half a kilometer long with soundings at 1 to 20 m intervals were conducted. Bed topography is presented and locally anomalous sections are examined. Smaller-scale parameters such as the attenuation constant of ice and reflector properties are also extracted from the data. Subglacial and englacial temporal variations were studied by automatically recording echoes at one location every 20 minutes over a three-day period. Such experiments are to be used in the future in conjunction with other, concurrent, geophysical and hydrological investigations.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

48896,"information","Geology of the northwest quarter of Whitehorse map area, Yukon and studies of weathered granitic rocks near Whitehorse","The oldest rocks exposed in the area are Upper Triassic sediments and volcanics of the Lewes River series. They are overlain, apparently with slight unconformity, by Jurassic clastic sediments of the Laberge series. A small area of coal-bearing rocks probably belongs to the Tantalus formation. Acid and basic volcanics of the Hutshi group overlie the Laberge series unconformably along the northern border of the area. Rocks of all the above groups are intruded by the Coast Range granitic intrusions. Greenstones and more highly metamorphosed rocks associated with the main intrusive complex appear to have been derived mainly from the Lewes River series. Flows of fresh basalt exposed in the southern part of the area are believed to be Tertiary in age. Evidence regarding the relation of the weathering to the glaciation is inconclusive and hence it is not known if the weathering is connected with the cool dry climate now prevailing at Whitehorse. Certain granitic rocks of the area appear to weather more readily than others. A study of mineralogy, texture and porosity of the main types of granitic rocks of the area shows that those granitic rocks that appear to be especially susceptible to weathering contain larger pores than less readily weathered granitic rocks, and it is suggested that this feature may partly explain the observed difference in weathering.

48897,"information","The gossan of a lead deposit in limestone, Yukon Territory","The interpretation of leached outcrops as guides to the specific minerals from which they were formed has been developed to a rather high degree by earlier workers, among whom Boswell and Blanchard deserve particular mention. In the present work, a gossan that led to the discovery of a lead deposit is described. Since many hand specimens of the limonite from this gossan lack the characteristic boxwork structures described by the authors above, microscopic investigations of thin and polished sections were carried out. However, the gossan is classified into six types mainly on the basis of its physical properties. At least three of these are correlated with types described by Boswell and Blanchard, one of pyrite derivation and the others from galena. The relative solubility of different limonite types in dilute HC1 was not found to be of as much value as some writers have indicated. The mineral deposits to which the limonite pointed the way have not been sufficiently exposed to allow detailed study, but the presence of tremolite and phlogopite in an area of disseminated mineralization indicates that this portion at least may be of contact metamorphic origin.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

48916,"information","Geology of Casino porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit, Dawson Range, Y. T","Casino porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit ia in the Dawson Range, midway between Dawson City and Whitehorse, Y.T. Mid-Cretaceous granitic rocks of the Klotassin batholith form the backbone of the Dawson Range and have intruded the Yukon Hetamorphic Complex of Paleozoic or earlier age. A 70 m.y. old volcanic unit, the Casino complex, intruded the Klotassin batholith, and is cogenetic with Casino deposit. Hear the deposit extrusive volcanic rocks are unknown but formation of a subvolcanic plug of feldspar porphyry was followed by an explosive event that formed a steeply plunging, conical breccia pipe. This permeable pipe, about 2,000 ft. (670m.) by 1,200 ft. (400m.) at the surface localized hydrothermal fluids that formed large concentrically zoned alteration patterns during upward and outward percolation. A potassic alteration facies core, about 1,500 ft. (500m.) in diameter, is centered approximately on the breccia pipe, and is characterized by secondary magnetite, biotite and potassium feldspar. This core is surrounded by phyllic (quartz, sericite, sulphide) alteration that extends about 1,000 ft. (330m.) into adjacent rocks of the Klotassin batholith. Chalcopyrite and molybdenite are concentrated in the phyllic zone along the potassic alteration side of a pyrite halo. Peripheral, weakly developed zones of argillic (clay-carbonate minerals) and propylitic (chlorite) alterations are present. This characteristic location of economically significant minerals within a zonal distribution of alteration minerals provides an important exploration guide for porphyry-type deposits in the area. Breccia formation and hydrotherrnal zoning appear interrelated and probably result from escape of metal-bearing saline solutions from ""wet"" magmas derived from an underlying Benioff zone associated with subduction of an oceanic plate. Supergene enrichment, preserved because the area is unglaciated, probably occurred mainly in the Paleogene and resulted in an increase in the grade of copper by an average factor of 1.7 through precipitation of chalcocite in a subhorizontal enriched zone. Copper added to this zone was extracted from up to 500 ft. (l70a.) of overlying capping rock. Controls for enrichment processes include grade of original hypogene copper, favourable breccia occurrence and alteration, and presence of pyrite. A plate-tectonic model relates the genesis of Upper Cretaceous to Tertiary porphyry-type deposits to the evolution of the western and central Canadian Cordillera. Existence of two Benioff zones is assumed from definition of two distinct younging trends of intrusive centres. The first Benioff zone, initiated west of the Queen Charlotte Islands near the Middle Triassic, continued activity until the early Tertiary when 50 m.y. old granitic rocks and associated porphyry deposits near the eastern boundary of the Coast Crystalline Belt were formed. The second Benioff zone, initiated near the earliest-Cretaceous, extended under the western margin of the North America plate and produced stocks and associated porphyry deposits that become younger from west to east across the Intennontane Belt. Intrusive activity associated with both Benioff zones ceased at about the same time, 50 m.y. ago, implying that they became imbricated. As a result, the North America plate overrode the Insular plate. Doubling of these plates is reflected in the late Mesozoic and Tertiary uplift and erosion of the Coast Crystalline Belt.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
48917,"information","Thermal studies related to surging glaciers","Deep-ice temperature measurements have been made in two surge-type glaciers in the Yukon Territory, Canada. Cold ice warming towards the bed was found in Trapridge Glacier and a model of basal ice temperatures predicts large regions of basal temperate ice. Thermal regulation of the surge behavior of this small glacier is inferred; theoretical considerations show that this hypothesis can reasonably be extended to large surging glaciers as well. Temperatures below 0°C were also recorded on Steele Glacier. An anomalously warm layer was detected at a depth of approximately 50 m. This is attributed to the severe crevassing associated with a glacier surge. Numerical modelling of the effects of water-filled crevasses in a cold glacier, refreezing and injecting latent heat into the ice, predicts temperature profiles very similar to that observed. The model further predicts long term maintenance of the resulting trapped water pockets and, in small surging glaciers, a thermal memory of the initial crevassing throughout the entire quiescent phase.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The centre of the map area lies about thirty miles north of Mayo, Yukon. Exposure is poor in many parts of the area, because of the thick Pleistocene cover. The rocks in the area are quartzites of the precambrian Yukon Group. Quartzite is generally micaceous and contains interbedded phyllite. Regional metamorphism (greenschist facies) has affected these rocks. An early bedding plane foliation has been modified by two distinct phases of folding. A granodiorite stock with related sills of similar composition has intruded the metamorphic assemblage and a five hundred feet wide thermal metamorphic aureole that contains corundum has been developed in the metasedimentary rocks around the stock. East trending and later north trending faults have disrupted the rocks. Mineralization in the area is of various types. Silver-lead-antimony veins occur in the west. A preliminary study of their mineralogy shows them to contain jamesonite, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, tetrahedrite and boulangerite in a gangue of siderite and dolomite. Secondary minerals include bindheimite or stetefeldite, anglesite, goethite, scorodite, covellite and chalcosite. Two stages of Pleistocene ice advance have modified the topography.

48922,"information","Geology of the Mount Brenner Stock near Dawson City, Yukon Territory","The Mount Brenner stock has intruded folded sedimentary and meta sedimentary rock that lie 40 miles northeast of Dawson City, Yukon. The stock consists of four major concentric zones: (l) an outer zone of fine to medium-grained augite-biotite monzonite; (2) a zone of very coarse-grained monzonite porphyry; (3) an intermediate zone of porphyritic horn blende monzonite; and (4) a central zone of coarse-grained pink quartz monzonite porphyry. Except for the outer zone, all rock types are porphyritic and the alignment of feldspar phenocrysts gives the rocks a primary flow structure which conforms to steeply outward dipping gradational internal contacts. All external contacts are sharp. The regional structural trend is modified in the vicinity of the stock so that beds are generally conformable with the intrusive contact. From structural evidence, it is concluded that at the present level of erosion, the stock was emplaced by forceful injection. The different rock zones of the stock can be accounted for by differentiation of an augite-biotite monzonite magma by a combination of crystal fractionation, volatile and alkali diffusion, and multiple intrusion.

48924,"information","Geochemistry of bedrock and soils in the vicinity of the Anvil Mine, Yukon Territory","Cambrian (?) schist and phyllite of the Anvil Range, Yukon, host three large stratabound lead-zinc deposits: Faro, Vangorda, and Swim. Because geological exploration is limited by a thick cover of glacial overburden, geochemical techniques were tested in the area. These include bedrock sampling for primary halos and geochemical marker horizons, and glacial overburden sampling for secondary dispersion patterns. Multi-element geochemistry of bedrock indicates that the schist and phyllite are not distinctive in one or any combination of the trace elements analyzed. However, some younger rocks are enhanced in various elements: amphibolite in Ni, Cr, Co, and Cu; rhyolite in Pb and Sn; and granite in Sn. Despite presence of glacial overburden, the trace element content of bedrock is reflected in soils. Soils overlying magnetic greenstones are enriched in Ni and Cu, whereas soils overlying granite are slightly enriched in Sn content. Detailed bedrock, overburden and soil sampling at the Faro deposit reveals that primary Pb, Zn, Mo, and Ba halos exist about the ore zone. Mo parallels the visible alteration envelope, but Pb and Zn extend into the hanging wall and  the footwall. Ba extends into the hanging wall but is not detected in the footwall. Secondary dispersion patterns are primarily related to the proximity of the Faro ore zone and type of parent material sampled. Till deposits have higher background and threshold values for Cu, Pb, and Zn than those of glaciofluvial deposits. Bath Pb and Zn distributions in overburden delineate the Faro #2 ore body; Zn extends to surface whereas Pb, in some cases, does not. This is a reflection of the type of overburden sampled. In general, Zn is the more consistent indicator of ore. The Zn anomaly is primarily hydromorphic in origin, cxZn having higher anomalous/threshold contrast than total Zn (11.1 for cxZn vs 4.8 for total Zn). The nature of the Pb anomaly is not understood.

48929,"information","Regional stream sediment reconnaissance and trace element content of rock, soil and plant material in eastern Yukon Territory","Multi-element stream sediment reconnaissance in the Hess River region of the Eastern Yukon has outlined an extensive area characterized by anomalously high molybdenum values. An accessible region in the Hess Mountains, within the high molybdenum zone, was selected for detailed study of trace element levels in stream sediment, rock, soil and vegetation. In view of the frequently observed relationship between high forage molybdenum concentrations and the incidence of copper deficiency in cattle, molybdenum concentrations in plant species likely to be consumed by caribou and moose were of particular interest. High sediment molybdenum values are characteristic of catchments underlain by dark shales and less commonly dark limestone. These rocks and associated soils are rich in molybdenum. Concentrations in vegetation growing on anomalous shaly soils are characteristically low, while most plants growing on soils derived predominantly from limestone are molybdenum-rich. The Mo-Cu status of vegetation on limey soils is typically within the range associated with molybdenum induced hypocuprosis in cattle. Low molybdenum uptake by plants on soils derived from shales likely reflects the unavailability of the molybdate anion, resulting from its adsorption onto clay minerals and sesquioxides under acidic conditions prevalent in these soils. In neutral to mildly basic environments, typical of dark limestone soils, molybdenum adsorption is greatly decreased, and therefore molybdenum is relatively available to plants. In the detailed study area soil pH values are typically similar to pH levels in associated stream water. Therefore by combining stream sediment molybdenum concentrations with stream pH data, catchments likely to contain molybdenum-rich vegetation can be predicted. Unfortunately stream pH values were not obtained in the regional survey. In view of the apparent rarity of dark limestone throughout the Eastern Yukon, however, molybdenum-rich vegetation is not likely to be particularily widespread. Wildlife in this area, therefore, is probably not significantly affected by molybdenum induced copper deficiency.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:45","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

48940,"information","Sampling problems and hydraulic factors related to the dispersion of scheelite in drainage sediments, Clea Property, Yukon Territory","Multifractional analysis for scheelite, magnetite, heavies, mediums, and lights, in drainage sediments downstream of the Clea tungsten-bearing skarn deposit, Yukon, revealed three interdependent problems that complicate interpretation of results of drainage surveys for W: (1) Scheelite concentrations in stream sediments reflect, in part, hydraulic sorting rather than source distribution. (2) Low numbers of scheelite grains in stream sediments cause high random sampling and subsampling errors and present analytical difficulties. (3) Scheelite/heavies or scheelite/mediums ratios may not be appreciably higher downstream of scheelite-bearing skarn than barren bedrock, because scheelite, heavies and mediums occur in increased amounts in skarns (i.e. they covary in source materials). Hydraulic effects result in systematic changes in mineral distributions between high and low energy environments (characterized by coarse gravel and fine gravel to sand, respectively). Scheelite, magnetite, heavies and mediums concentrations in -10-mesh sediments are greater in high energy environments, and this relative enrichment increases with grain size and density (up to one-hundredfold for scheelite). Using a regression method, developed in this study, hydraulically equivalent sizes of magnetite and heavies were empirically determined for finer (3.0-3.5 phi and 3.5-4.25 phi) scheelite sizes. Ratioing the weight of scheelite to that of a hydraulically equivalent mineral greatly reduces hydraulic variability. Resulting profiles of hydraulically equivalent scheelite concentrations more clearly delineate locations of scheelite input to the stream. The rare-grain problem can be reduced at the sampling level by sampling from high energy environments and/or by sampling for finer scheelite. Heavy mineral separation is the most effective means of reducing the rare grain problem at the subsampling and analytical levels. The problem of covariance in source materials can best be remedied by ratioing to an individual (hydraulically equivalent) heavy mineral which has a constant and ubiquitous distribution in the area of interest. In this study, magnetite shows promise, but more information on its source distribution is needed.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:45","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

48955,"information","Babbage River delta and lagoon; hydrology and sedimentology of an Arctic estuarine system","Inputs, transfer processes, and storage characteristics of water and sediment have been investigated in a 40-km² estuarine system on the central Yukon coast. The setting is transgressive, microtidal, and high-latitude (69°N). The Babbage Estuary system can be subdivided into fluvial, tidal-distributary, delta-plain, intertidal, lagoon, marginal-supratidal, and barrier subsystems, each associated with one or more distinctive depositional environments and characteristic lithofacies assemblages. The structure of the system has been examined in terms of links between subsystems and overall system response to input perturbations. Although the propagation of tide and surge within the estuary may be treated as a quasi-linear stochastic process, transfers of fluvial water and sediment through the system are highly non-linear. Furthermore, the parameters of the system change dramatically on an annual cycle. Inputs and associated system responses are dominated in the short run by seasonal- and synoptic-scale variance, the former reflecting major seasonal adjustments in the phase distribution, circulation process, iand input regime of the estuary. The annual salinity cycle, with a range of at least 60 ppt, exhibits a short reaction and long relaxation response to major snowmelt runoff inputs in May or June, when salt water is flushed completely out of the estuary. Wind-generated waves are effectively absent from the system during 8-9 months of the year, but play a major role during the open-water season. Although direct transport of sediment by ice is relatively unimportant, ice effects are pervasive; they include, in addition to restriction of winter runoff and surface wave generation, creation of hypersaline conditions, control of the sedimentologically important flood events on deltaic supratidal flats, enhanced rates of coastal recession due to thermal degradation of ground ice, and production of distinctive thermokarst morphology on supratidal surfaces. Water level, storage volume, salinity, and suspended sediment series during the open-water season in the lagoon are dominated by synoptic-scale wind effects. In the delta, the major synoptic-scale anomalies of sediment concentration are related to storm runoff. At long time scales, the estuarine system has been dominated by rising sea level and coastal recession; Holocene climatic fluctuations may also have been important. A transgressive sequence has developed, including various distinctive features, notably the absence or limited development of aeolian, backbarrier-margin, tidal-delta, and intertidal marsh facies, a largely afaunal intertidal component, and deltaic deposits with poorly developed levees and abundant lake basins. The basal fluvial component includes a sinuous gravel channel assemblage of a hitherto poorly documented type. The Babbage Estuary barrier sequence is primarily transgressive, but incorporates localized elements of progradational and inlet-migration models. Examples of major transgressive, progradational, and inlet-fill barrier sequences occur in close proximity on the central Yukon coast.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:45","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

These ideal metal distribution patterns are easily interpretable in more classical zoning terms as mineral distribution patterns. To establish a zoning model samples that span a wide range of grades are rearranged in order of decreasing silver contents. The resulting ""rearranged"" profiles for other elements are then evaluated relative to silver. Computer-based curve fitting methods are useful means of generalizing these ""rearranged"" metal profiles. The foregoing procedure has been used to develop a general model for the Keno Hill - Galena Hill camp based on analytical results from 3 main deposits (Keno, Husky, No Cash) including 6 veins. Essential character of the model is embodied in analyses of Ag, Pb, Zn, and Ca and the Zn/Ag ratio. Additional but in cases ambiguous detail is added to the model by Hg, and Co and/or Ni analyses. These elements allow vein mineralogy to be monitored in a quantitative manner and provide a practical zoning model that can be used as an exploration, tool in evaluating underground workings for proximity to oreshoots in the more than 60 deposits known in the camp. A companion study involving whole rock K-Ar age determinations of small stockwork zones adjacent to Ag-Pb-Zn veins indicated an age of mineralization of about 87±2 Ma. for the Ag-Pb-Zn veins.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:45","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
48963,"information","Stratigraphic, structural, and tectonic setting of an upper Devonian-Mississippian volcanic sedimentary sequence and associated base metal deposits in the Pelly Mountains, southeastern Yukon Territory","The central Pelly Mountains in southeastern Yukon Territory consist of imbricate thrust sheets, which have undergone syn and post-thrusting deformation and metamorphism. The local geology is further complicated by intrusion of Upper Cretaceous batholiths, and by strike-slip faulting related to the Tintina Fault, a major northwest-trending transcurrent fault of uppermost Cretaceous or early Tertiary age. This faulting disrupts the northeast edge of the study area. Upper Devonian and Mississippian strata are present in at least two of the thrust sheets, but the Mississippian volcanic rocks occur in only one of them. The volcanic rocks consist of volcaniclastic material with minor interbedded flows, and were deposited in a submarine environment. Several coeval and cogenetic syenite and trachyte domes and small stocks are the remains of vent areas. Although the volcanic rocks are all highly altered and show evidence of widespread chemical mobility, trace element data indicate that the rocks are meta-luminous trachytes, most closely resembling peralkaline volcanics generated in extensional environments. This suggestion of a predominantly extensional tectonic setting in mid-Mississippian time in the Pelly Mountains is consistent with recent tectonic syntheses for the area. Stratabound and stratiform massive base metal sulphide deposits that occur within the Mississippian volcanic sequence are similar in many respects to the Kuroko-type volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits of Japan. The Pelly Mountains deposits, however, are among the first known occurrences in the world of Kuroko-type mineralization in a rift environment.

48964,"information","Geology of the Guano-Guayes rare earth element bearing skarn property, Pelly Mountains, Yukon Territory","The Guano-Guayes property, in the Pelly Mountains of Yukon, covers a rare earth element (REE) bearing contact metamorphic aureole which developed around a syenite stock during Mississippian time. Sedimentary rocks consist of several hundred metres of Ordovician dark gray shale which are faulted upward adjacent to Silurian interbedded impure calcite and dolomite marbles and quartzites overlain by Silurain quartzite. Sedimentary rocks are on the steeply, west-dipping limb of a regional anticline. The syenite, at the southeast end of a northwest-trending belt of syenite stocks and associated volcanic rocks, consists of 40 to 90 percent orthoclase in laths up to several cm long, and of up to 60 percent mafic minerals now mostly altered to biotite. Rare earth element values of syenite, when normalized to chondritic values, have a crustal pattern with magnitude slightly higher than that of crustal rocks. Dikes, believed to be cogenetic with syenite, intrude sedimentary rocks within and inear the contact metamorphic aureole. These dikes are dark-coloured and originally contained up to 25 percent zircon (now partly altered to secondary minerals). Zircon is enriched in total REE and relatively enriched in light REE compared to syenite, probably due to selective partitioning of REE. REE patterns in skarn and sedimentary rocks suggest that fluids circulated through syenite and carried trace amounts of REE from it into the skarn. There was no significant movement of REE from dikes into skarn or sedimentary rocks. Contact metamorphic rocks can be divided into three units: quartz-muscovite hornfels, dark green diopsade-calcite-phlogopite-tremdlite-sphene skarn, and light green diopside-calcite-phlogopite skarn. Depth at time of intrusion of syenite, as estimated from regional geologic contraints, was around 1 to 2 km (circa 500 bars). Parageneses and textures observed in thin section in contact metamorphic rocks indicate that prograde metamorphism at this pressure reached a maximum temperature of 450 to 540 degrees C, with heat being transferred from the intrusive dominantly by fluids. The mole fraction of CO2 in metamorphic fluids, increased By the liberation of CO2 during prograde metamorphic reactions, was moderate. Large amounts of Fe, Mg, and possibly Si02, were added to the skarn. Retrograde metamorphism involved significant addition of water to the system, proven by the appearance of secondary epidote, chlorite, and, later, serpentine. Extensive retrograde metamorphism accompanied by large-scale migration of elements through syenite ended 206 ±15 Ma ago (syenite whole-rock isochron) and the last resetting event took place between 156 ± 5 Ma (K-Ar date on biotite-altered arfvedsonite) and 128 ± 25 Ma (syenite mineral isochron). Petrology, geochronometry, and rare earth element studies presented here have contributed to an understanding of the genesis of syenite, skarn, and mineralized dikes within the Guano-Guayes area.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:45","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Stratiform barite-lead-zinc mineralization on the Tom claims is contained in two tabular zones separated by a fault. Both zones occur at the transition between Upper Devonian locally derived coarse clastic rocks and overlying basinal shales. Ore textures vary from massive quantities of poorly bedded galena, sphalerite and pyrite to finely laminated barite and cherty argil lite with disseminated sulphide minerals. A mineralized and altered breccia body underlies the stratiform massive sulphide mineralization.

In this thesis, field, lithogeochemical and Nd isotopic data are presented for felsic and mafic igneous rocks in the FLR to understand the tectonic setting, style of magmatism, and their relationships to VHMS mineralization. All rocks in the FLR were built upon a continental (or continent-derived) substrate of pre-Mississippian (>365 Ma) age. The Fire Lake unit (FLU) reflects Devonian-Mississippian (-365-360 Ma) arc and back-arc magmatism built upon a composite basement of oceanic and continental (or continent-derived) crust above an east-dipping subduction zone. Models proposed herein for the magmatic and tectonic evolution of FLU include: 1) arc magmatism punctuated by back-arc basin generation; 2) ridge propagation into an evolving arc with subsequent evolution to back-arc magmatism; and/or 3) ridge-subduction (slab-window) with eventual back-arc basin magmatism. The Kudz Ze Kayah (KZK) unit overlies the FLU and consists predominantly of crustally derived Devonian-Mississippian (-360-356 Ma) felsic volcanic and high-level subvolcanic rocks and variably carbonaceous sedimentary rocks; the latter are crosscut and overlain by alkalic mafic rocks. The high field strength element (HFSE)-enriched (A-type) felsic rocks and alkalic mafic rocks in the KZK unit are inferred to represent magmatism within an ensialic back-arc basin upon evolved crust. The Wolverine succession (WS) unconformably overlies the KZK unit and consists of a lower succession of felsic volcanic and subvolcanic rocks with carbonaceous sedimentary rocks; the upper portion of the succession, above the Wolverine VHMS deposit, consists predominantly of aphyric rhyolitic rocks that are overlain basalt flows. Felsic rocks ofthe WS are broadly similar to those in the KZK unit and represent ensialic back-arc basin magmatism. However, the succession is younger (-356-346 Ma), and post-dates a period of uplift, deformation, and erosion prior to commencement of back-arc magmatism. Back-arc spreading eventually evolved to true seafloor spreading within the WS. Massive sulphide deposits in the FLR are preferentially associated with rocks indicative of high temperature magmatism (e.g., boninites, A-type felsic rocks) and extensional tectonic activity (e.g., back-arc rifting and spreading).","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:52","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

49485,"information","Hydromechanical behaviour of a surge-type glacier; Trapridge Glacier, Yukon Territory, Canada","Subglacial hydrological and mechanical processes play a critical role in determining the flow characteristics and stability of glaciers and ice sheets, but our understanding of these processes remains incomplete. Instrument and modelling studies of conditions beneath Trapridge Glacier, a small surge-type glacier in the St. Elias mountains, Yukon, yield additional insight into subglacial hydromechanical behaviour. High-pressure pulses in the subglacial drainage system are indicated by sudden offsets in measured pressure and result from damage to the pressure sensor measurement diaphragm. Laboratory and modelling studies confirm that pressures significantly above the transducer rating produce offsets comparable to those observed in field records. Instrument records suggest that high-pressure pulses are generated by abrupt glacier motion that compresses or dilates the subglacial hydraulic system. Analysis of instrument records taken during summer 1995 reveals that a series of hydromechanical events occurred following the establishment of a subglacial drainage system. Pressure fluctuations in this drainage system weakened a basal region that was acting as a pinning point, resulting in three episodes of strong basal motion. A simple hydromechanical model of basal processes acting beneath a softbedded alpine glacier was developed. In this model, the glacier bed is divided into three regions: softbedded and hydraulically-connected to the subglacial drainage system, soft-bedded and unconnected, and hard-bedded. Each basal region is modelled as a one-dimensional column. The time evolution of pore-water pressure, till dilatancy, sediment deformation and glacier sliding is calculated in soft-bedded regions; hard-bedded regions are considered rigid and impermeable. The regions are coupled by a simple ice-dynamics model. Sediment deformation is calculated for four till flow laws: linear-viscous, nonlinear-viscous, nonlinear- Bingham and Coulomb-plastic. Modelled pore-water pressure profiles, deformation profiles, basal shear stress and instrument responses are presented for the four flow laws. Comparison of synthetic and field instrument responses suggests that till behaviour is best represented as Coulomb-plastic.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:55","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

In the hope of better constraining the timing of regional ductile D (sub 2) and D (sub 3) deformation, geochronology samples of four plutonic bodies have been collected during the 1995, 1996 and 1997 field seasons. Initial results of the study are promising as U-Pb dating of zircons from the Mendocina Orthogneiss within the Teslin Zone has confirmed a Devonian age, and dating of monazites from the Dycer Creek Stock and Last Peak Granite has bracketed the age of regional F (sub 3) folding between 113 and 98 Ma. These findings suggest that at least part of the regional deformation may be younger than previously proposed.

49861,"information","Temporal, geochemical, isotopic, and metallogenic studies of mid-Cretaceous magmatism in the Tintina Gold Province, southeastern Yukon and southwestern Northwest Territories, Canada","The Tintina Gold Province (TGP) of east-central Alaska, Yukon Territory, and the southwestern Northwest Territories comprises a very large number of gold (± base metal) deposits and occurrences that are spatially and temporally related to mid-Cretaceous intrusions. Intrusions in the eastern Selwyn Basin, south of MacMillan Pass and east of Frances Lakes, include some of the largest bodies within the TGP and are the focus of this study. Magmatic rocks of the TGP have been divided into individual plutonic suites on the basis of crystallization age, lithology, mineralogy, geochemistry, and spatial distribution, as well as metallogenic association. From -111 Ma to -99 Ma, magmatism is thought to reflect the formation of a southwest-facing continental magmatic arc, represented by the Whitehorse - Coffee Creek suite, and that the coeval Anvil and Cassiar suites formed in a back-arc environment. The younger Tay River, Tungsten and Tombstone plutonic suites successively stepped inboard between 99 Ma to 89 Ma. However, the processes leading to such volumetrically significant magmatism remains poorly understood. Intrusions within the study area range in composition from granite to granodiorite with subordinate diorite and are characteristically calc-alkaline, peraluminous to weakly metaluminous, relatively reduced, and typically contain only biotite as the dominant mafic phase. Sixteen new U-Pb ages, ranging from ~107 Ma to -91 Ma, constrain a temporal framework for plutonism across the region that is consistent with the progressively ""inboard younging"" pattern of magmatism observed in the northern and western portions of the TGP. - Geochemical (major, trace and rare earth elements) characteristics, together with geochronology indicate that the Anvil, Tay River, Tungsten, and Tombstone plutonic suites as originally defined farther to the northwest do continue southeastward and into the southwestern Northwest Territories. Initial Sr ratios and epsilon Nd values (n=20; age corrected for T = 100 Ma) range from 0.70853 to 0.72243 and -6.0 to -17.5, respectively. Lead isotopic compositions (n=20) show relatively narrow ranges for 2 0 6Pb/2 0 4Pb, 2 0 7Pb/2 0 4Pb, and 2 0 8Pb/2 0 4Pb ratios of 19.397 to 19.772, 15.697 to 15.829, and 39.461 to 39.883, respectively. All radiogenic isotope systematics indicate that these magmas have interacted extensively with or were derived entirely from continental crust. Several spatial and temporal trends are apparent in the data including an increase in overall REE abundance and sNd values, and a decrease in Srjnit ai, values with decreasing age (broadly moving from west to east). These trends may reflect differences in the nature of the underlying basement, potential magma source(s), and/or the melt producing processes that were involved. Lead isotope compositions of feldspars from various intrusions and sulphides from associated precious- and base metal deposits and occurrences define narrow and overlapping ranges indicating that the metals in many of the mineral deposits (and prospects) in the region are mostly derived from the mid-Cretaceous TGP intrusions.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:03","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The north trending RMA is interpreted as a contractional (pop-up) structure, bounded on the east and west by post-Carboniferous, pre- or syn-Cretaceous thrust faults, that is cored by lower Paleozoic and Proterozoic rocks. The location of the pop-up may have been controlled by a pre-existing west-facing crustal scale ramp at the top of the crystalline basement, because horizontal displacement required to accommodate the pop-up, about 33 km, probably occurred above regional detachment(s) which project westward beneath the Eagle Plains.

49923,"information","Late Cenozoic history of McQuesten map area, Yukon Territory, with applications to placer gold research","The late Cenozoic history of McQuesten map area is characterized by progressively less extensive glaciations and deteriorating interglacial climates. The glaciations, from oldest to youngest, are the pre-Reid (a minimum of two early to mid Pleistocene glaciations), Reid (>200 ka), and McConnell (<29.6 ka BP). Pre-Reid interglacial reconstructions suggest a much warmer and more humid climate than today. The Koy-Yukon interglacial (200 ka) is considered to have a climate similar to a southern boreal forest and the first intact Diversion Creek paleosol, from this period, is documented in the McQuesten River valley. The Stewart neosol (Holocene) is widespread and poorly developed in comparison to past interglacial soils. The distribution of surficial deposits, related to multiple glaciations, physiography, and fluvial order contrasts, may govern the distribution of placer gold occurrences in the study area. Placer deposits occur anomalously in areas outside the pre-Reid limit on Klondike Plateau, and on Stewart Plateau.

Low  velocities near the glacier surface are apparently due to melting, fracturing, and high porosity. It is concluded that velocity anisotropy is  mainly caused by the foliation structure of alternating layers of clear and bubbly ice; it also occurs where surface ice has a strong fracture  pattern. Greatest depth of ice in the Central Arm, 3,000 m wide, and in the combined glacier, 5,000 m wide, is about 1,000 m. The North  Arm is less deep; both arms are roughly parabolic in cross section. The base of the ice is lower than the glacier terminus, but no bedrock  depression was found at the confluence.

Diamicton is interpreted as glacial till;  other facies are fluvial/glaciofiuvial in origin. Sediments have a number of geomorphic settings, including Holocene colluvium, alluvial  fans and stream deposits; Reid periglacial alluvial fans; and pre-Reid glacial and glaciofluvial deposits. Previous workers suggested  that significant placer gold concentrations occur only in alluvium that lies either upon bedrock or glacial till. New data from this study suggests that significant amounts of placer gold also occur in the diamicton, primarily at the diamicton/bedrock contact. Gold concentration in the diamicton is likely due to glacial erosion and incorporation of a supergene-enriched bedrock mantle and pre-existing auriferous alluvium.

50028,"information","Geology and genesis of copper deposits and associated host rocks in and near the Quill Creek area, southwestern Yukon","The Kluane Ranges are underlain by a sequence of stratified rocks ranging in age from Permian to Triassic, cut by Cretaceous and Tertiary intrusions. Flow and pyroclastic rocks of Lower Permian Station Creek Formation were probably part of a volcanic arc  environment. Argillaceous and tuffaceous rocks of the Transition Zone of Station Creek Formation and overlying sedimentary rocks of  Lower Permian Hasen Creek Formation were deposited in a subaqueous environment, possibly a back-arc basin. Upper Triassic basalts of the Nikolai Greenstone are largely subaerial and were probably a product of rift volcanism. Prominent copper lode deposits in the  Kluane Ranges include: (1) vein and disseminated types in Station Creek volcanic rocks; (2) nickel-copper associated with Kluane complexes; and (3) vein-type in the Nikolai Greenstone. A narrow, positive range of sulphur isotopic compositions for vein sulphides in  Station Creek Formation contrast sharply with a large range for those in the Nikolai Greenstone. The former deposits resulted from only  local mobilization of sulphur (and metals) during metamorphism in a closed system, whereas mineralization in the Nikolai Greenstone  involved considerable variation in chemical parameters of ore fluids in an open system with more than one source of sulphur.

50076,"information","Energy exchange during river icing formation in a subarctic environment, Yukon Territory","Icings are common hydrologic phenomena in cold subarctic environments. They are formed by the accumulation of repeated overflow layers during winter. The size and thickness of the icing layers, however, are determined by the interaction of surface water hydrologic and microclimatologic systems. This paper examines the energy exchanges associated with icing layers with different thicknesses. In the case of thick layers of overflow, ice layers require a longer time to freeze completely due to greater latent heat stored in larger water volumes. Milder air temperatures will slow growth even further. Under such conditions, flowing water between the top ice cover and the underlying ice body provides significant amounts of energy. As much as 60-87% of the energy may be supplied by running water. Under progressively colder temperature conditions, faster growth rates reduce the time of water flow and, therefore, reducing the relative amount of energy supplied by flowing water. In this case energy is provided mainly by the latent heat released by the freezing of water contained in the overflow layer. Under certain conditions, the absorption of solar radiation also generates a considerable amount of energy input to the regime. This energy is released mostly through sensible and radiative heat losses. During icing layer formation, latent heat is the least important, accounting for only 6-17% of the total heat loss.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:07","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

50304,"information","The paleogeography of glacial lake Laberge.","During retreat of the Cassiar lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet from the last glacial maximum there was a large stagnation or re-advance near what is now the north end of Lake Laberge (Lower Laberge) in the south central Yukon. This stagnation generated a large moraine that would come to act as a sediment dam for Glacial Lake Laberge. As the retreat of the ice front resumed a lake formed between the ice front to the south, and the sediment dam to the north. With the ice front continually drawing further south, combined with incision of an outlet flow into the sediment dam, the geomorphology of Glacial Lake Laberge constantly changed. Throughout the history of Glacial Lake Laberge there has been a gradual decline in the lake level largely controlled by incision into the sediment dam near Lower Laberge, as is indicated from sets of fluvial terraces above the current outlet river (the Yukon River). This gradual decline has produced several sets of preserved shorelines rising above the present lake level. By surveying the shape, location, and elevation of these shorelines and outwash terraces, in combination of all other applicable data sets, a detailed glacial retreat and alluvial history can be examined.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-04-04 03:04:12","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

However, in the Yukon Territory, concerns about exploring for this commodity have often been voiced through the environmental assessment processes and other vehicles. It appears that the relatively low risk associated with uranium in its natural mineral forms is poorly understood. To assist with educating community members and other stakeholders about uranium, the Yukon Mining and Petroleum Environment Group has engaged the CANMET Mining and Mineral Sciences Laboratories (CANMET-MMSL) to prepare fact sheets explaining the properties of uranium and providing information on modern uranium mining, processing and end product storage. It is hoped that such fact sheets will help Yukoners better understand the geochemistry of uranium and the uranium mining cycle, dissipating the apprehension over uranium exploration and facilitating a more detailed assessment of the uranium potential in the Yukon Territory.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-06-29 02:06:07","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

50319,"information","Seismic line recovery in the Southeast Yukon: Patterns and processes","Increased interest in oil and gas exploration in the Yukon is leading to an increase in the use of seismic exploration as a tool for identifying potential drill sites. Although there are a number of techniques that have been developed over the years to minimize disturbances associated with seismic exploration, in some cases the information that needs to be gathered dictates that a less than environmentally optimal treatment be employed. Seismic line cuts can cause a number of outcomes from significant environmental degradation to lines that are barely a whisper on the landscape. Studies conducted in the Eagle Plains and Peel Plateau areas in 2006 and 2007 have provided significant information on the ecology of recovery of seismic lines in these areas. The results of these studies were presented at the 2007 Oil and Gas Best Management Practices Symposium in Inuvik in October, 2007. The South Eastern region is different ecologically from the Eagle Plains and Peel Plateau region. The lower elevation sites in the South Eastern region are vegetated by substantial forests of white spruce, poplars and birch while the Eagle Plains area is tundra at higher elevation and black spruce / Labrador tea scrub forests at lower elevations. The relation to recovery processes in the North Yukon bears consideration as the general processes of recovery illustrate elements that should be considered when seismic lines are cut. This study builds on the studies completed in 2006 and 2007 and provides information that illustrates the ecological characteristics of seismic line recovery as a tool for the continued development of best management practices and standard operating procedures for oil and gas exploration.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-06-29 03:06:30","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
50320,"information","Assessment of low permeability cover as infiltration and oxygen barrier to reduce acid generation in mine tailing at the Arctic Gold and Silver Mine Site, Carcross, Yukon","The production of acid rock drainage (ARD) from mine tailings is a significant environmental concern at various abandoned mine sites in Yukon. Leachate with low pH and high dissolved metals concentrations deriving from mine tailings impoundment areas can negatively impact various groundwater and surface water resources.

The presence of both oxygen and water is required for ARD to develop. Therefore, the reduction of the oxygen and water sources from the mine tailings will limit ARD production. This is the basis of reclamation of the Arctic Gold and Silver (AGS) Tailings Site near Carcross, Yukon using a lowpermeability tailings cover which acts as an oxygen and water infiltration barrier. ARD processes have resulted in a significant contamination of the groundwater beneath the tailings impoundment at the AGS site with multiple dissolved metals showing elevated concentrations.

The use of a low permeability cover to reduce ARD such as that used at the AGS site is one of the first such reclamation applications in Yukon. EBA Engineering Consultants Ltd. and partners initiated a performance assessment of the low permeability cover system in the fall of 2000 and continued the monitoring in 2001 as part of Mining Environment Research Group (MERG) funded studies. The results of these assessments suggested that the low-permeability cover functions as an oxygen and infiltration barrier; however, the limited data and short period of monitoring precluded any prediction of the long-term performance of the tailings cover. Further monitoring was recommended.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-06-29 03:06:49","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The current database of knowledge is largely based on research from southern stream environments which tend to be warmer than Yukon streams. This presents a challenge for regulators and practitioners interpreting data from northern systems using guidance that is developed and defined by southern baseline data and effects. This study was designed using a preliminary approach to assist in filling the current information gap. The Selwyn Basin in the Yukon has natural elevated concentrations of metals including arsenic, mercury and selenium (EDI 2008, Gartner Lee 2007). Water quality studies that have been conducted within the Selwyn Basin have not considered the importance of metal speciation and changes in mobility and exposure to aquatic organisms inhabiting lotic watercourses likely impacted by both naturally elevated and anthropogenic (mining related) metal input sources. The objective of this project was to increase the understanding of metal speciation in relation to surface water and sediment metal concentrations within the Selwyn Basin at six discrete lotic watercourse sites over two seasons.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-06-29 03:06:01","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
50322,"information","Alternative methods for the reclamation of an exploration trail off the Dempster Highway, Yukon ","In 2004 and 2005, methods for restoring the damage done to the permafrost layer of an exploration trail was investigated using natural and bioengineered techniques rather than mechanical means. The impacted trail was created in November 2002 and is located off Kilometer 159 of the Dempster Highway. The methods included backfilling the impacted areas with adjacent vegetated material and transplanting plugs or islands of vegetation from donor areas in the immediate vicinity. Hand collections of seeds of various species growing on site were dispersed over some of the mitigated areas. Live willow staking was conducted at a stream crossing.

The exploration track was 1.2 km in length. Approximately half of the access trail required remediation of some form, the remainder having minimal or no disturbance. The techniques of using native material to backfill the impacted areas, and willow staking to channelize the stream flow at the lower crossing has been effective in controlling erosion and restoring the site. The hand-spread grass and sedge seeds hastened colonization on the applied areas. Although these techniques are labor intensive they definitely are effective and inexpensive, especially on a small scale. The
trail appears to be largely restored by July 2009 with some sections of the trail virtually indiscernible from the surrounding environment. It is doubtful that had the application of gravels and peat moss using dump trucks (the initial recommendation) been undertaken in 2004, the final result would not have been as successful.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-06-29 03:06:23","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

From the 2009 MPERG call for proposals: “The use of various “passive” treatment technologies is being proposed as a possible panacea to provide efficient, cost effective treatment of pit water and metal bearing water discharges. The long term effectiveness of these treatments in a northern environment needs to be investigated.” Passive treatment of some kind has been considered for many years due to its appeal in comparison with mechanical-chemical treatment plants which are now required to operate almost in perpetuity at many closed mine sites. An observation that makes bioremediation so attractive are the many natural analogues observed around mine drainages that naturally attenuate or otherwise reduce metals burden in mine drainage without apparent harm to the host aquatic ecosystem. These include fen-bogs, swamps and other wetland structures which renovate mine drainage; effectively removing and in many cases sequestering contaminants. The original term “wetland treatment” has given way to “passive treatment” and/or “biological treatment” in recent years.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-06-29 03:06:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The three experimental sites are at Mount Skukum, United Keno and Wellgreen. The experiments consisted of either seeding the tailings with various populations of the tufted hair grass and/ or with stratified (cold temperature treated) seed of the shrub soapberry, or making transplants of the same two species. The treatments included the addition of compost from the City of Whitehorse, addition of fertilizer as 7:7:7 pellets, addition of organic matter as sheep manure, peat or woody debris from on site and, in the case of Wellgreen, a lime addition to overcome the strong acidity.

The results are striking and illustrated in the Plates 1-15. Data of performance and flowering success are shown in the Tables, as are chemical analytical data in the Figures and Tables. Plots set up in 2003 provide a nucleus for effective re-vegetation, having survived for 6 years. The success of the seedings and transplants at Mount Skukum and United Keno was good, while that at Wellgreen was very poor. Wellgreen has suffered flooding with washing out of plots and washing out of the neutralizing lime. Nevertheless, in compost additions plots at Wellgreen, set up in 2005 and 2006, a small amount of re-vegetation and survival has occurred, especially in the wetter areas near the tailings pond.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2011-06-29 03:06:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Our mapping characterizes the nature of the Cache Creek terrane in Yukon, including the identification of a previously unknown siliciclastic package, informally named the Michie formation, a gabbroic intrusive complex, and the Marsh Lake intrusive complex, in addition to more typical oceanic lithologies. This mapping helps refine the structural history of the area and define the relationships between Cache Creek terrane and rocks of Stikinia and Whitehorse trough. Two main phases of compressional deformation have been identified: 1) an initial phase of west-verging thrusting, emplacing Cache Creek terrane rocks above rocks of Stikinia and the Whitehorse trough along the Judas Mountain thrust, a northern equivalent to the Nahlin fault; and 2) a subsequent, second phase of thrusting which reshuffles Stikinia and Whitehorse trough rocks onto the Cache Creek terrane along the east-verging Mount Michie thrust.

Based on its low Al2O3, Na2O, and TiO2 contents, the primary melt was derived from a harzburgitic source, was most likely picritic in composition, and required mantle potential temperatures above those recognized for the ambient mantle. Constraints on mantle melting place the mantle at ~6 km, a depth that would require significant crustal attenuation.
Although the volcanic rocks at Mount Harper are the same age as the Franklin Large Igneous Province, the geochemical trends are distinct. Apart from their age, the only plausible link would be to consider the MHVC as the product of a partial melt at the margin of a dispersed mantle plume.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2013-02-25 12:02:08","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Reconnaissance fieldwork in July 2012 involved measuring and sampling outcrops in each jurisdiction. One hundred eighty-seven metres of Besa River Formation shale and mudstone was measured and described in the Yukon part of Liard basin (NTS 95C/11). The section comprises three lithofacies: 1) mudstone and shale; 2) silty mudstone and shale; and 3) interbedded mudstone/shale and silty mudstone and shale. Shale is generally recessive, fissile, carbonaceous, very thinly laminated (<1 cm), and black on fresh surfaces. Mudstone is more competent than shale, thin to medium-bedded (1-5 cm), and medium to dark grey on fresh surfaces. Mudstone has variable silt and silica components based on observations of hand samples. Fossils are rare and include cephalopod impressions and unidentified biological fragments. The sampling program involved spectral gamma-radiation readings at one-metre intervals, and chip samples through two-metre intervals for Rock-Eval/total organic carbon, vitrinite reflectance, X-ray diffraction mineralogy, lithogeochemistry, and microfossil biostratigraphy.

Rheological contrasts between these mafic rocks and amphibolite facies metasedimentary hosts have resulted in variable foliation development, especially at margins of mafic bodies. Initial foliation development centred on granitoid material in magmatic intrusion breccia, and was enhanced by syn-metamorphic biotite formation. Early mineralized quartz vein development occurred under greenschist facies conditions during and/or after regional Mesozoic thrust stacking of kilometre scale rock slabs. Initial vein emplacement was largely controlled by the foliation in mafic gneiss, and minor chloritic alteration and later hydrothermal generations cut across all structures. Gold mineralization involved only minor introduction of As, Sb, and S, and the hosting quartzite has higher As, Sb, and S content than most mineralized veins.

Six samples from different veins contain measurable concentrations of Re and Os and plot with significant variation on a Re-Os isochron diagram. The results indicate the need for detailed sampling of one vein system to better constrain age and source information from Re-Os systematics.

The nearby Toni Tiger molybdenum showing is characterized by quartz-molybdenite veins cutting Late Permian meta-aplite and garnet-pyroxene skarn of uncertain age. We present geochronological evidence that gold and molybdenum were deposited at 96-95 Ma, approximately 3 m.y. after intrusion of the Dawson Range batholith and Coffee Creek granite. Fluid inclusions from mineralized quartz veins suggests that gold at Boulevard and molybdenite at Toni Tiger were formed from similar H2O-CO2-NaCl type fluids between 279 and 310°C and >1 kbar. We conclude that both are part of the same mineralizing system, and that structurally-hosted gold at the nearby Coffee deposit and in the Moosehorn Range of western Yukon may be broadly related, post-arc orogenic systems developed during exhumation of the Dawson Range in mid-Cretaceous time.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2013-02-25 01:02:49","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

In the upper Hyland River area, contact aureoles approximately 300 m wide are developed around the Hyland and Boundary plutons, which are members of the 97-94 Ma Tungsten plutonic suite. Andalusite + cordierite + biotite-bearing assemblages in the aureole of the Hyland pluton imply emplacement at ~2.5-3 kbar, equivalent to a depth of 9 to 11 km. Cordierite + biotite assemblages in the aureole of the adjacent Boundary pluton suggest emplacement at shallower levels (<~2.5 kbar or <9 km). Metamorphism associated with these intrusions took place after most regional deformation. In contrast, rocks adjacent to the older (ca. 106 Ma) Mount Billings batholith were metamorphosed syn-kinematically. Staurolite ± andalusite ± sillimanite-bearing assemblages in metapelites east of the Mount Billings batholith indicate metamorphism at deeper levels (~4 kbar, or 15 km depth), coincident with the formation of structures oblique to the regional trend.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2013-02-25 01:02:36","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Benefits include portability and ease of use, real-time acquisition of XRF data with minimal processing, immediate availability and analysis of data in the field, and a reasonably large number of elements that can be measured reliably. The findings indicate that data for 15 elements obtained with an Innov-X Omega pXRF analyser (2010 version) correlate well with lithogeochemical whole-rock analyses with R² values generally =0.7. The difference in elemental abundances between pXRF analyses of thin section off-cuts (a proxy for drill core) and pulps from the whole-rock analyses are generally ± 35%, indicating that no sample preparation is needed for the rock samples analysed in this study. The uncorrected pXRF values of some elements can be very similar to whole-rock analytical abundances; however, it is recommended that uncorrected pXRF data only be used semi-quantitatively, such as for downhole elemental plots in which relative patterns or trends are more informative than individual data points. For more sophisticated plots such as those combining elements into ratios to form alteration indices, corrected pXRF data should be used. The pXRF data are also adequate for construction of simple volcanic composition plots that can be used to aid in identification of protolith compositions of altered samples. The pXRF is well suited to volcanogenic massive sulphide exploration as the analytical data obtained from drill core (using thin section off-cuts as a proxy) are comparable to whole-rock analyses and the range of immobile and mobile, major and trace elements should be versatile enough for most exploration programs. However, pXRF shouldn’t be viewed as a replacement to traditional whole-rock geochemical methods.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2013-02-25 01:02:51","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

This structural setting lies at the interface between the dominantly clastic Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic rocks of Selwyn basin and coeval carbonate rocks of Mackenzie platform. The principal host rock to mineralization is a variably decarbonatized silty limestone, although where permeability has been enhanced by shearing, siliciclastic rocks may also contain significant amounts of gold. Alteration and associated processes related to mineralization include decarbonatization of host limestone with subsequent silicification and brecciation.

The predominantly metavolcanic Klondike schist contains carbonate as disseminated porphyroblasts and as coarse quartz-carbonate segregations, and contains rare layers of marble. Chemical staining and LA-ICP-MS analyses reveal that, irrespective of paragenesis, carbonate is dominated by Mg-Fe-Mn calcite. Laser spectroscopic analyses of C and O isotopes reveal that marble is a 13C-enriched isotopic reservoir compared to carbonate in micaceous schist. Carbonate in gold-stage veins has a similar isotopic signature to carbonate in metamorphic segregations and porphyroblasts in the host rocks. We tentatively interpret these results to indicate that the CO2 component of vein carbonate has been remobilized from local sources during brittle deformation. The results of this study may bear on interpreting the scale of rock-fluid interaction during orogenic gold mineralization in the area.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2014-01-24 10:01:23","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Placer-lode relationships have been established through study of gold alloy compositions and associated mineral inclusion assemblages. At Casino, hypogene gold grains are liberated by erosion and pass into the placer system without compositional modification, as evidenced by the common alloy signatures and a mineral association of Au, (Bi-Pb-Te-S) minerals and chalcopyrite. A second signature of higher-Ag, chalcopyrite-poor gold has been identified in placer populations, but this gold type also exhibited the Bi-Pb-Te-S signature. The results suggest that the placers contain a mixture of gold derived from the porphyry and peripheral or shallow level epithermal mineralization. The Bi-Pb-Te-S association evident at Casino was also recorded at Revenue/Nucleus and Sonora Gulch. This generic signature of gold in Cu-Mo (-Au) porphyry deposits and their associated distal epithermal manifestations could be applied to exploration in areas where placer-lode relationships are unclear.

Fieldwork in summer 2013 involved locating, measuring, and sampling Canol Formation strata in the Richardson and northern Ogilvie mountains. In June, 229 m of Canol Formation strata were measured on the Trail River, eastern Richardson Mountains (NTS 106L/6). The Canol Formation at this location is entirely exposed, except for ~2 m at its upper contact with the overlying Imperial Formation. On Trail River, the Canol Formation is a resistant, silica-rich unit that is characterized by rhythmically bedded siliceous shale and chert comprising four lithofacies: 1) siliceous shale; 2) chert; 3) siliceous shale (>50%) and chert (10-50%); and 4) chert (>70%) and siliceous shale (10-30%). Siliceous shale is fissile, finely laminated in beds up to 10 cm thick, and may be either soft and recessive or hard and resistant. Chert exhibits conchoidal fracture and occurs in beds up to 16 cm thick. Both shale and chert are black in color on fresh surfaces, and weather grey to black, olive grey, brown with a distinct yellowish orange, dark red, and/or very minor apple-green weathering residue. The lower contact of the Canol Formation with Road River Group calcareous shale is sharp, and marked by a concretionary bed overlain by a thin (<1 m) weathered mineralized zone. This mineralized zone may be in-part correlative with the Ni-Zn-PGE “Nick” horizon observed in the region. A marked lithology change occurs from the Canol to the Imperial formation which consists of weathered mudstones with a significantly lower silica content. Concretions up to 2.5 m long were observed in the Canol Formation but possible fossils were only observed at two locations where unidentified impressions on a bedding surface could be biological (or mineralogical). Fine-grained pyrite occurs throughout the formation, either as disseminated grains, in thin laminations (mm-scale), and rarely in concretionary horizons. The sampling program involved spectral gamma-radiation readings at one-metre intervals, and chip samples through two-metre intervals for Rock-Eval/total organic carbon (RE/TOC) and inductively coupled plasma-emissions/mass spectroscopy lithogeochemistry (ICP-ES/MS). Targeted samples for microfossil biostratigraphy, vitrinite reflectance, and XRD mineralogy were also collected. Laboratory results are anticipated in 2014.

In the St. Cyr klippe near Quiet Lake south-central Yukon, serpentinite units of the Slide Mountain oceanic assemblage are thrust above phyllite units of the Cassiar terrane. This contact has the potential to contain jade deposits similar to the ones found at the King Arctic mine. However, bedrock mapping during the summer of 2013 failed to identify large jade deposits within the field area, but smaller jade deposits may have been overlooked. The absence of jade mineralization could be due to the lack of fluid migration through faults, but is more likely due to the low silica content of the phyllite.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2014-01-24 10:01:40","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Several different tectonostratigraphic elements were identified including rocks of the Yukon-Tanana terrane, the Kluane schist, and the Bear Creek assemblage. These were tectonically juxtaposed into a northeast dipping structural stack with the Yukon-Tanana terrane occupying the highest structural level, followed by the Kluane schist and the Bear Creek assemblage. Two plutonic phases of probable mid-Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous age were identified to intrude the Kluane schist and the Yukon-Tanana terrane respectively. A large Paleocene aged batholithic intrusive suite, the Ruby Range suite, intrudes across all tectonic boundaries.Tectonic and stratigraphic relationships observed in southwest Yukon are strikingly similar to those found in southeast Alaska, near Juneau.

An aggradational stage in which gold concentration occurred within sedimentary features.iii. A lacustrine layer representing a depositional hiatus.iv. A final, more rapidly aggrading fluvial stage.Identification of the lacustrine layer has clarified the evolution of the WCG depositional fluvial systems. Architectural element analysis and detailed sedimentological observations have been synthesized to gain a clearer understanding of the spatial variations within the WCG.

The early Neoproterozoic Fifteenmile Group in the Ogilvie Mountains has previously been shown to archive important information on the evolution of the biosphere, including ocean redox and early evolution of eukaryotes. Here, we formally define the Chandindu Formation, a 150 to 420-m-thick siltstone-dominated mixed carbonate-siliciclastic succession of the lower Fifteenmile Group in the Coal Creek and Hart River inliers. We present ten sections of the Chandindu Formation and propose a type section and formalization to promote the development of a consistent stratigraphic framework for Proterozoic successions in northwest Canada.The Chandindu Formation begins with muddy tidal flat facies, which are succeeded by shale-siltstone-sandstone coarsening-upward cycles deposited in a predominantly subtidal environment. However, carbonate occurrences throughout the entire unit suggest localized carbonate buildups, likely nucleated on fault-bound paleohighs where siliciclastic background sedimentation was low. These paleohighs originated from rift-inherited complex basin topography and syn-depositional faulting during deposition of the upper Chandindu Formation.

Jurassic alteration is characterized by zones of pervasive quartz sericite alteration of metamorphic minerals and disseminated brassy pyrite. Jurassic pyrite is locally anomalous in gold, but is generally barren. Cretaceous gold mineralization overprints Jurassic sericite alteration and is characterized by veins and breccia infilled with gold-bearing, dark grey, ‘sooty’ arsenian pyrite. In biotite-rich host gneiss, disseminated arsenian pyrite extends outwards from fracture zones along biotite-rich metamorphic foliation and pre-existing Jurassic shears. In altered Late Cretaceous igneous rocks, gold-bearing arsenian pyrite replaces primary biotite.

The intrusions are composed of unfoliated or incipiently foliated, fine to coarse-grained, equigranular and porphyritic, biotite ± hornblende quartz monzodiorite to granodiorite. They are metaluminous to peraluminous and have reduced to oxidized geochemical characteristics. The composition of selected samples is consistent with magma formation from partial melting of infracrustal source rocks.U-Pb ages were obtained for nine plutons from five or six zircon single-grain analyses by the isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry method with chemical abrasion (CA-TIMS). All interpreted ages are concordant within statistical uncertainty. The plutons range in age from 99.80 ± 0.03 to 97.70 ± 0.03 Ma. Given the primarily unfoliated nature of the plutons, contractional, fabric-forming deformation within the Cordilleran orogeny must therefore have largely ceased at the present level of exposure in the Coal River area by the time of intrusion (ca. 98 Ma).The ages and compositions of the plutons in Coal River map area are consistent with their being part of the Tay River plutonic suite, a northwest-trending belt of coeval and compositionally similar plutons and local volcanic rocks (South Fork volcanic suite) that, when augmented by the addition of the Coal River plutons, extends approximately 465 km with a width of up to 150 km.

This paper texturally and chemically characterizes four generations of pyrite in grey to black mudstones and siltstones, but focuses 83% of the analyses on early and late diagenetic pyrite. Diagenetic pyrite from the Conrad occurrence is trace element poor with respect to deposit-proximal pyrite from shales in the Northern Carlin Trend of Nevada, but is similar in composition to distal diagenetic pyrite in these Nevada shales. Diagenetic pyrite from the 3Ace occurrence is very similar in composition to pyrite around the giant Sukhoi Log deposit in eastern Russia. It can be preliminarily concluded that the trace element composition of diagenetic pyrite from the Conrad and 3Ace occurrences is permissive of a locally derived intrabasinal sedimentary pyrite gold source.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2014-01-24 12:01:05","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

68388,"information","Geology of the Main Zone at Mt. Skukum, Wheaton River area, southern Yukon","Gold mineralization at the Mt. Skukum deposit occurs in nearly vertical quartz-carbonate veins which crosscut flat-lying andesites with a NNE trend. The mineralized veins represent the second stage of a two stage hydrothermal system, the first of which resulted in emplacement of thin chalcedonic veinlets. These two stages of veins are probably indicative of an evolving hydrothermal fluid rather than being representative of two separate events.

Vein emplacement is one of the latest of a series of events which began with volcanism, producing felsic and andesitic volcanic rocks which overlie basement in this area. Subsequent periods of tectonism produced large faults along which rhyolitic dykes were emplaced. Continued tectonism resulted in reactivation of old faults along which andesitic and dacitic dykes were injected, crosscutting rhyolite dykes in many cases. As volcanic activity waned, the faults remained active, leaving zones of high permeability which acted as conduits for the still active hydrothermal circulation.

Veins appear to have been emplaced at low temperature in a circulating hydrothermal system driven by a heat source at depth associated with dykes present in the area. Circulating hydrothermal fluids may have leached gold from the surrounding andesitic volcanics during propylitization. Permeability may have been controlled by faulting, brecciated flow tops and bottoms, and lapilli tuff horizons. Gold was precipitated in highly permeable conduits, such as the Main Fault Zone and breccia bodies.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2014-02-13 10:02:57","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Variations of dipole-dipole, inverse Schlumberger and pole-dipole arrays, as well as an array developed by Advanced Geosciences Inc. of Austin, Texas were used. Two-dimensional inversions of each array for each line were carried out to produce 2D resistivity and IP cross sections. These sections provided the fundamental information for the study.

The deposits used in this report are Brewery Creek, Dublin Gulch, Flame and Moth, Klaza, Charlotte, Coffee, QV, Golden Saddle, and Williams South.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Ground Geophysics","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2014-10-02 09:10:49","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Arsenian pyrite replaces primary metamorphic mica by sulphidizing Fe in the host, while pervasive dolomite-illite alteration destroys the host and eventually consumes early mineralized pyrite. Silicification of host rocks is observed with associated arsenian pyrite deposition due to cooling. Brecciation of silicified intervals by coarse grained hydrothermal quartz occurs later with additional pyrite deposition. Mineralized intervals are oxidized by late, meteoric fluids which consume Au-bearing pyrite and release micron-scale free gold from the pyrite crystal lattice into the remnant oxides. Sulphidized biotite within the 98 Ma Coffee Creek Granite constrains mineralization to <98 Ma. Similar metal associations (Au-As-Sb vs. Au-As-Sb-Pb-Zn-Cu) suggest Coffee potentially represents the shallower, epizonal extension of the mesozonal orogenic Boulevard gold deposit, with a late epithermal overprint.

As part of the CASE-15 expedition, co-led by the Yukon Geological Survey and the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, fieldwork in July 2013 involved measuring and sampling Boundary Creek Formation strata in two locations, and investigating a burning shale exposure near the confluence of Boundary Creek and the Big Fish River. Shale and mudstone samples were analyzed for XRF lithogeochemistry and organic matter quantity, along with thermal maturity and type using RockEval/TOC and vitrinite reflectance techniques.  The Boundary Creek Formation is interpreted to have been deposited by turbidity currents moving through an outer shelf to slope environment in the distal part of the foreland basin, outboard of the Cordilleran orogeny. Lithogeochemical data suggest that at times throughout the deposition of Boundary Creek Formation shale, ocean water may have been depleted in oxygen, resulting in anoxic conditions that would have been favourable for organic matter preservation. Analyses of surface samples suggest that some areas have poor to no petroleum potential and are thermally overmature with respect to oil generation. In others, good to very good petroleum potential exists and the shale is oil to oil and gas prone and thermally mature with respect to oil generation. In these latter areas, specifically in the vicinity of the type section on Boundary Creek, the shale has the necessary components for spontaneous combustion: pyrite, organic matter and a fresh supply of oxygen provided by a landslide. Although burning shale is not unknown in northern Canada, the outcrop of burning shale on Yukon’s North Slope is the first observed in shale of the Upper Cretaceous Boundary Creek Formation.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2015-01-23 10:01:08","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Dilution by terrigenous input was minimal; however, fluctuating palaeoproductivity resulted in significant biogenic silica enrichment that reduced porosity. The Canol Formation was divided into four regionally correlatable chemostratigraphic zones. Each zone was characterized by up-section profiles of: decreasing biogenic silica enrichment, increasing proportions of siliceous shale relative to chert, decreasing redox-sensitive Mo, U and V enrichment factors and decreasing Mo/TOC (total organic carbon) ratios. A preliminary sequence stratigraphic framework was constructed and eustasy invoked as the dominant allogenic control. Mo/TOC ratios are indicative of a silled, restricted basin with euxinic deepwater. The overall decrease up-section of these ratios suggests increasing restriction over time, associated with relative sea-level fall.

The Ogilvie Mountains, located east of Dawson City, have proven especially problematic for chronological studies. This study will attempt to test a relatively new dating method on penultimate surfaces in the Ogilvie Mountains; Chapman Lake is the primary study area. Using a vertical sampling method to construct a cosmogenic depth versus concentration profile in outwash gravel, this research will determine whether Marine Isotope Stage 4 or 6 provided the conditions necessary for ice nucleation to build the penultimate glacial surface. The age calculated by the depth profile is supported by radiocarbon ages and macrofossil samples, optically stimulated luminescence ages, TCN boulder dating, as well as detailed stratigraphy of significant sites near the Chapman Lake moraine. The results will help determine the effects of climate forcing in this region and its relationship to the existing glacial framework of the territory.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2015-01-23 10:01:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Breccia clasts with soft sediment deformation textures were previously identified and interpreted as fragments of the Wernecke Supergroup that were torn off and carried upward during mud volcanism. This model was subsequently discounted because field relations and geochronology indicated that the Wernecke Supergroup was lithified and metamorphosed prior to brecciation. Our recent work confirms the presence of soft sediment within zones of Wernecke Breccia and demonstrates the need for an unlithified sediment source. Two types of soft sediment materials have been identified: red mudstone to sandstone, and green mudstone. These unlithified sediments were likely derived from late Paleoproterozoic water-saturated sediments. During breccia formation, the surface was breached and fragments of the unlithified sediments foundered into the breccia zones, mixing with clasts of lithified wallrock. The sediments descended to depths of at least 4 km where they were lithified and encased by hydrothermal cement.

The purpose of the assessment was to highlight prospective conventional hydrocarbon accumulations, and generate input for use in future resource assessments.

More than 60 000 m of strata were analyzed in the study. Based on three sets of cutoff criteria, reservoir and pay intervals were identified. The results identify hydrocarbons in 19 stratigraphic intervals, in 29 of the 31 wells analyzed. The best conventional hydrocarbon potential, assessed by net pay thickness, proportion of total net pay, proportion of net pay to formation/member thickness, and proportion of reservoir rock filled with net pay, was identified in the Carboniferous stable platform tectonostratigraphic succession followed in order by a Lower Paleozoic platform carbonate horizon and Permian sedimentary rocks of the Ancestral Aklavik Arch.

69462,"information","Enhanced interpretation of regional geochemical stream sediment data from Yukon: catchment basin analysis and weighted sums modeling","Geochemical data from regional geochemistry survey samples from Yukon have undergone exploratory data analysis and principal component analysis. The results of these analyses clearly demonstrate geological control on the distribution of a number of important commodity and mineral deposit pathfinder elements. Catchment basins have been delineated for the samples and the dominant simplified geological unit in each catchment basin used to level the geochemical data where appropriate. Levelling the geochemical data in this fashion generally fails to fully account for enrichments in many commodity and mineral deposit pathfinder elements in the bedrock due to practical limitations on the resolution of the mapping and knowledge of the relative contributions of different geological units, although the resulting data interpretation is an improvement on one based solely upon raw geochemical data. Weighted sums models have been generated for the deposit types that either exist within the individual map areas covered by this report or are considered by the authors to be of exploration significance. Separate catchment maps showing the distribution of stream water pH and the concentration of elements inferred to have accumulated through hydromorphic dispersion are also provided. An additional series of maps has been generated to display weighted sums models calculated using regression of commodity and mineral deposit pathfinder elements against those principal components containing the same elements that show the strongest spatial associations with bedrock geology. Both model types have been iteratively tested using known mineral occurrences in the relevant map areas and, for the most part, are compatible with the distribution of known mineralization where sampling coverage is adequate. Geochemical anomalies unrelated to known mineral occurrences are evident in both data sets and provide possible targets for further investigation.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Basin modeling,RGS,Regional geochemical survey,Stream sediment geochemistry","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2015-08-03 10:08:20","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

69471,"information","Provenance and depositional framework of braided and meandering gravel-bed river deposits and associated coal deposits in active intermontane piggyback basins: The Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Tantalus Formation, Yukon","The Tantalus Formation developed within confined intermontane river valleys during the late stages of collision and amalgamation of Stikinia and associated arc systems with the North American plate in Upper Jurassic and early Lower Cretaceous times. While most of the extensive chert pebble conglomerate in the Tantalus Formation can be interpreted as shallow braided gravel-bed river deposits, some may represent the products of deposition from deeper, braided and meandering gravel-bed rivers. Floodplain and lake deposits are restricted to poorly exposed slope forming intervals. Coal deposits developed locally on abandoned segments of floodplains in confined river valleys, in places associated with high constructive river deposits. The age profiles of detrital zircons indicate major contributions from reworking of older strata, combined with continued un-roofing of the Stikine terrane. In addition more distal sources were tapped in the Yukon-Tanana and adjacent terranes to the north and west of the Whitehorse trough. Much of the chert in the Tantalus Formation appears petrographically similar to chert in the Cache Creek terrane, now preserved only to the south of the Whitehorse trough. As both decrease in maximum grain size, and paleocurrents, are generally south to southwesterly trending, this source is considered unlikely. Chert may have been derived from now eroded supracrustal rocks that once formed the top of the Yukon-Tanana terrane, or more likely from an obducted block of Cache Creek terrane once present to the north and west of the Whitehorse trough. The latter may have been thrust over metamorphosed rocks of the Yukon-Tanana terrane beginning in the early Bajocian, and has subsequently been removed by erosion. A proximal North American cratonic source is excluded, as there are no Archean zircon grains in the Tantalus Formation. The possibility that strata of the Tantalus Formation may host significant conventional reserves of oil or gas is very low, due to lack of trapping mechanisms. There may be some undiscovered coal reserves, and limited potential for coal-bed methane production.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Sedimentology,geochronology","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2015-12-02 12:12:58","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Plutonic rocks are cut by steep, west to northwest-striking andesite dikes of uncertain age. Alteration and mineralized zones coincide with fault-fracture zones that are parallel and proximal to dikes and their margins. Alteration is characterized by an early phase of calc-sodic (albite-amphibole) and potassic (pervasive biotite and fracture-controlled K-feldspar) alteration and a later phase of silica flooding and sericite alteration. Gold mineralization is associated with disseminated sulphides in zones of silica flooding and with variably sheared veins of quartz-carbonate-arsenopyrite ± pyrite ± freibergite ± stibnite ± sphalerite.

To identify secular trends in regional tectonics and metallogeny, a multi-year project on the stratigraphy of the Pelly Mountains in the Quiet Lake (105F) and Finlayson Lake (105G) map areas was initiated. Field studies during summer 2015 focused on two stratigraphic intervals: (1) mafic volcanic, volcaniclastic and clastic rock successions assigned to the Cambrian-Ordovician Cloutier and Groundhog formations (Kechika group); and (2) felsic volcanic, volcaniclastic and clastic rock successions assigned to the Devonian-Mississippian Black Slate and Felsic Volcanic formations (Seagull group). Cambrian-Ordovician strata were deposited in a marine environment characterized by episodic mafic volcanism and extensional tectonism.

69483,"information","The Paradise gravel: Evidence for a pre-White Channel Gravel in the Klondike","New stratigraphic interpretations of exposures at Dago, Preido and Paradise hills on lower Hunker Creek suggest a more complex stratigraphic framework for the development of high-level bench gravels in the Klondike than has been previously put forward. A highly-altered gravel has formerly been interpreted to be part of the lower White Channel Gravel sequence and its degree of alteration attributed to enhanced groundwater diagenesis near the bedrock contact. New mining exposures indicate this altered gravel, here informally termed ‘Paradise gravel’, is laterally extensive and the alteration is not restricted to the bedrock interface. Furthermore, a cross-section reconstruction shows the White Channel Gravel is stratigraphically inset into the Paradise gravel. Alteration of the Paradise gravel is possibly a function of pedogenesis, suggesting a period of landscape stability followed its deposition. This pattern of sedimentation and potential stability was repeated within the lower White Channel Gravel and recorded by a zone of clay alteration and iron oxidation. 
Economically, the Paradise gravel is significant. At each locality investigated, the primary pay streak occurs in the Paradise gravel. Conversely, the White Channel Gravel is only economic where it sufficiently erodes and reworks the Paradise gravel. In nearby drainages, including upper Hunker Creek, the White Channel Gravel more completely reworks Paradise gravel to bedrock and becomes the pay unit. Preservation of the Paradise gravel documented in lower Hunker Creek may be due to its broad valley morphology. Future studies are recommended on the sedimentology of the Paradise gravel to understand gold distribution both vertically and within the pay channel(s). In addition, research into the pedogenic alteration could provide information on past climates during the Neogene.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2016-01-25 09:01:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

These data have been correlated with previous descriptions of in situ mineralization to elucidate placer-lode relationships and systematic change in gold compositions between porphyry and epithermal environments.
Gold alloy from the porphyry environment is Ag-poor with respect to Au formed in later stage veins. Silver, and to a lesser extent Cu, have been the main discriminants for inferring the source of Au within the placers, and in general, vein mineralization is a more important source-type than porphyry mineralization.
The signature of Pb-Bi-Te previously identified in the inclusion suites of Au grains from Nucleus/Revenue, Casino and Sonora Gulch has also been identified at Klaza, demonstrating that generic compositional signatures can underpin a robust exploration methodology.

Aerochem is an airborne sampling system (patent pending) that reduces the helicopter overhead inherent with conventional sampling, particularly in difficult to reach areas such as rugged terrain or dense vegetation.

Although beneficial from cost-efficiency and safety perspectives over conventional hand stream sediment sampling, a key question is whether the data gathered by the airborne technique are equivalent to the conventional technique. A comparison test to assess whether sampling biases exist and are significant to the geochemical outcome was performed in August of 2015, in the Kluane area of Yukon. Three samples were collected from each of 68 sites, one using the Aerochem technique and two using conventional hand-sampling.

79428,"information","Curie point depth mapping in Yukon","Curie point depth (CPD) mapping in Yukon was done using public domain aeromagnetic data from Natural Resources Canada. CPD mapping estimates the depth in the Earth’s crust to the Curie point temperature (~580°C) where magnetization in rocks disappears. When used in combination with other data, such as heat flow, CPD mapping can serve as a regional scale geothermal prospecting tool. In this study, two different CPD methodologies were employed using two different window sizes (200 km and 300 km). Qualitatively, the results were broadly consistent regardless of the method or window size. South-central Yukon exhibits shallow CPD values while northern and southeastern Yukon have deeper CPD values. This suggests that south-central Yukon has higher levels of heat flow in the mid-to-lower crust compared to the rest of the territory. The CPD results are largely consistent with heat flow measurements from the near surface. Specifically, regions with shallow CPD estimates correspond to areas with elevated heat flow measurements. Geologically, the regions with shallow CPD correspond to the Cordillera, while deep CPD areas appear to be co-located with continental platform rocks of Ancestral North America. Comparison with Yukon-specific crustal geotherms derived from other data suggest that the CPD estimates for south-central Yukon are systematically too deep by 2 to 12 km. The discrepancy is likely caused by the need to better understand and account for the fractal distribution of magnetization in the crust in Yukon. The results of this CPD study are valuable in that 95% of Yukon has been demarcated into regions of shallow CPD (higher heat flow) and deep CPD (lower heat flow). These findings should be combined with other data, such as heat generation and sediment thickness estimates, to identify the most prospective regions of elevated subsurface heat in Yukon.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,airborne magnetics,geothermal,heat flow","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2017-05-15 01:05:58","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Rankings for each of these attributes are combined into quality indices to give an overall impression of reliability for each catchment that can be incorporated into mineral exploration targeting criteria and design of further sampling programs. Data from quality control samples included with each sample batch during a recent re-analysis program are also assessed for some key elements. Standard reference materials included in two separate re-analysis campaigns show slight shifts in bias even though the same analytical method was used in both instances. Some elements, particularly Au, show an unacceptable amount of scatter in repeat analyses of the standard reference materials indicative of a non-homogenous distribution of Au in the materials for the small sample mass (0.5 g) used for analysis. Data precision is assessed using field and blind duplicate analyses for selected elements. The Au analyses show the poorest precisions, with data from Cu giving the best precision and data for As yielding intermediate precisions.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Basin modeling,RGS,Regional geochemical survey,Stream sediment geochemistry","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2017-06-14 09:06:10","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

79496,"information","Bedrock geology of the Teslin Mountain and east Lake Laberge areas, south-central Yukon","Mafic volcanic and clastic strata of the Middle Triassic Joe Mountain Formation, east of Lake Laberge, Yukon, represent a juvenile volcanic arc sequence. Mafic volcanic rocks of the Upper Triassic Lewes River Group were formed in the spatial and temporal continuity of Joe Mountain volcanism. Carbonate sedimentation took place in shallow oceanic subbasins adjacent to the arc from the Carnian to Rhaetian; these subbasins were separated by physiographic boundaries inherent to the arc, resulting in lateral stratigraphic variations. Polymictic conglomerate and turbiditic sequences of the Lower-Middle Jurassic Laberge Group unconformably overlie Triassic rocks. Two north-northwest strike-slip faults, the Laurier Creek and the Goddard, control the distribution of units. Joe Mountain Formation rocks are characterized by an east-west structural trend, whereas the Upper Triassic and Jurassic sequences are characterized by north-northwest trending tight folds and thrust faults. At least five post-accretion igneous suites intrude or overlie older stratigraphy, including the Late Cretaceous Open Creek volcanic complex.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 10:01:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
79497,"information","Clast fabric analysis of glacial diamict at the Allan Creek section and its implication for paleo-ice flow of Liard Lowland, southeastern Yukon","The Allan Creek section was identified and briefly described during reconnaissance mapping of the Watson Lake map area (NTS 105A) several decades ago and provides southeastern Yukon’s most complete known record of glaciation. The region supported ice sheets during multiple Quaternary glaciations, with landforms in Liard Lowland recording the ice flow toward the southeast during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Inference of earlier ice-flow patterns requires sedimentologic characterization of glacial deposits underlying Liard Lowland. We expand macro-scale descriptions of the sequence of four diamict units exposed in the Allan Creek section to provide further insight on paleo-ice flow in southeastern Yukon. Pebble fabrics were measured from each diamict unit to compare with known LGM ice-flow directions and previously reported clast orientations. Three of the diamict units record ice-flow along the NW-SE trend of Liard Lowland. The second highest diamict in the sequence may record ice-flow directions both parallel and transvers to the basin’s trend. Only the lowest diamict unambiguously indicates unidirectional ice-flow; it suggests southeastward paleo-flow during early glaciation of southeastern Yukon, similar to that during the LGM.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 10:01:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Research interests include: 1) shale chemostratigraphy and biostratigraphy, and pyrite trace element geochemistry to characterize shale units and assess lower Paleozoic paleoenvironmental conditions and depositional controls; and 2) an assessment of hyper-enriched black shales, specifically the colloquial ‘Nick’ or ‘Ni-Mo’ mineralized Ni-Zn-Mo-PGE deposit, in order to develop internally consistent genetic and exploration models for these types of deposits.

79499,"information","New contributions to the bedrock geology of the Mount Freegold district, Dawson Range, Yukon (NTS 115I/2, 6 and 7)","The Mount Freegold district is an ideal natural laboratory to evaluate the structural and magmatic framework for porphyry, skarn and epithermal mineralization in the Dawson Range. The district is located within a major extensional relay zone of the Big Creek fault system, a regionally significant dextral strike-slip structure in which localized extension facilitated the emplacement of mid to Late Cretaceous magmatic rocks. New mapping defines a previously unrecognized granite pluton at Mount Freegold, as well as the ca. 77 Ma Stoddart pluton, which represents the magmatic roots of hypabyssal intrusive rocks at the Revenue Cu-Mo-Au-Ag deposit and Nucleus Au-Ag-Cu deposit. The relay zone in the Big Creek fault system is partly plugged by the ca. 70 Ma Seymour Creek stock, which is cut by a southern strand of the fault system. Episodic fault movement took place over a minimum 35 m.y. interval during which at least three distinct epochs of magmatic-hydrothermal mineralization occurred.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 10:01:32","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Two glacial limits are identified: a higher limit recording the most extensive glaciation of the area; and a lower limit that records younger, less extensive glaciation. This paper describes Pleistocene limits of the Donjek Glacier and the distribution of surficial materials in the upper Quill, Maple, and Wade creek drainages. The source and transport mechanism of surface materials has particular significance for surficial geochemistry sampling programs and implications for mineral exploration are addressed.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 10:01:25","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Exploration work at the Mod property in 2016 has indicated that the sulphide mineralization is deformed (hence it predates the adjacent Cretaceous Seagull batholith) and that it demonstrates textures that are not consistent with a skarn origin.  If, indeed, this mineralization is of exhalative origin then a large region of Yukon-Tanana terrane becomes prospective for mineralization similar to that of the Finlayson VMS district.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 11:01:20","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

We present herein preliminary fieldwork on Yukon-Tanana terrane (YTT) host rocks that are the groundwork for future petrologic, isotopic, and geochronologic studies of the stratigraphy and crustal evolution of the VMS deposits and YTT rocks in the Finlayson Lake region and other peri-Laurentian terranes of the northern Cordillera. During the summer of 2017, we logged seven drill holes that intersected the stratigraphic hanging walls and footwalls of the mafic-hosted Fyre Lake and felsic-hosted Kudz Ze Kayah and GP4F VMS deposits. The stratigraphic results generally reveal finely laminated to bedded mafic or felsic volcaniclastic rocks that are interbedded with clastic rocks or cut by intrusive rocks and reflect changes in depositional environments and tectonomagmatic regimes in the Late Devonian to Early Mississippian.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 11:01:05","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The limestone is lithologically similar to the Espee Formation of the Ingenika Group, but is in geological continuity with the Hyland Group. The Hyland and Ingenika groups are age-equivalent sequences that were in close proximity before they were separated by Cenozoic dextral displacement on the Tintina fault. The area may therefore contain evidence for stratigraphic linkages between the two groups. The limestone is interpreted to have been deposited in a high-standing region outboard of the Hyland Group type-area. Further work is required to determine the extent to which late Neoproterozoic paleobathymetry aligns with Paleozoic platform/basin margins.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 11:01:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

An improved understanding of the structural framework for gold mineralization is essential for continued exploration success and interpreting ore fluid controls. Structural observations from the Osiris cluster of the Nadaleen trend indicate that NW-verging F1 folds were refolded in response to later SSW-NNE directed contraction. F2 folds have a subvertical ESE-striking axial plane with subvertically plunging axes on steep F1 limbs and subhorizontal fold axes in shallow F1 limbs. F2 folds have a pervasive axial planar cleavage that is recognized regionally. The steeply dipping Osiris and Nadaleen faults appear to cut all folds. Mineralization is spatially associated with later NW-striking faults in the Conrad zone. Much of the folding within the mineralized Conrad limestone is synsedimentary and its geometry reflects its emplacement as an olistostrome.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 11:01:16","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

A two-year project was initiated to test a Sinemurian to Toarcian transgression of basal Laberge Group strata westward across the Whitehorse trough and examine the regional relationships between the timing of Jurassic exhumation, sedimentation, and terrane accretion in the northern Canadian Cordillera. Field studies in 2017 targeted basal Laberge Group strata at seven locations in central Yukon. At each field locality, basal Laberge Group strata are known or inferred to unconformably overlie the Povoas formation and multiple units of the Aksala formation. Pre-Early Jurassic unconformities may indicate variable basin topography due to the complex internal stratigraphy of the Lewes River Group, or that regional exhumation and erosion affected the Whitehorse trough prior to Laberge Group sedimentation.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2018-01-18 11:01:57","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

A quality control comparison between detailed mapping in the Indian River drainage and a regional PEM data set indicates that wetland area is underestimated by approximately two thirds within the PEM data set. Despite this, the PEM is useful at locating areas of wetland abundance from a regional perspective. Within the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Traditional Territory, the Ogilvie Mountains and Tintina Trench contain the largest concentrations of wetlands, whereas the Klondike Plateau has approximately 50% less wetland density due to topographic characteristics. When analyzing wetland distribution for the Klondike Plateau ecoregion that spans the border between Yukon and Alaska, the largest wetlands are located distal to the Yukon River in valleys that have not been affected by Pleistocene base level change. Overall average wetland coverage, for all study areas, is estimated to be upwards of 10% of the landscape. Their abundance is attributed to a combination of suitable terrain, Pleistocene aeolian sedimentation, periglacial processes and a climate supporting extensive discontinuous permafrost. Understanding regional wetland distribution through PEM can help frame significance when considering land management decisions that weight the placer mining economy and environment.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2019-01-24 02:01:35","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Three structural panels, separated by south and southwest dipping thrust faults, subdivide the area. Cambrian (?) to Ordovician metasedimentary and volcanic rocks underlie the southwestern panel and include all exposures southwest of the Duo fault. Ordovician to Silurian (?) siliciclastic and carbonate strata and phyllite units that are intruded by Late Devonian porphyritic rocks underlie the central panel. Silurian (?) to Triassic siliciclastic and carbonate strata in the northern panel occur to the north, and in the footwall of, the Twopete fault. Mid-Cretaceous granitic rocks that crop out near Kalzas Mountain and occur below the surface near Dromedary Mountain intrude the central and northern panels. Northeast-verging folds and thrust faults deform layered rocks in the northeastern Glenlyon area and are offset by north-south oriented, steeply dipping structures with both normal and strike-slip motion.
Upper Devonian Earn Group strata host layered sulphide bodies and polymetallic veins that contain lead, zinc and silver. This mineralization occurs in the footwall of the Twopete fault, a regional structure that originally developed as a Late Devonian synsedimentary fault.
Ordovician and Silurian (?) quartz-rich clastic rocks are unlike coeval basinal facies rocks mapped elsewhere within the Selwyn basin in Yukon.

81647,"information","Constraints on the evolution of placer deposits at Gladstone Creek, Yukon (NTS 115G/7, 8)","Gladstone Creek hosts a productive placer mine and has been glaciated at least three times. Glaciations eroded bedrock and reworked surficial materials, depositing thick sequences of sediment in Gladstone valley, which were subsequently fluvially incised during deglaciation and non-glacial intervals. Fluvial incision and reworking concentrated detrital gold in coarse gravel units that commonly overly bedrock or false-bedrock surfaces. Identifying false-bedrock units in stratigraphy may help placer miners target economical gold deposits perched above the valley bottom.
Gold grain samples were collected from four gravel units. Characterization of gold grain morphology and laser ablation ICP-MS analysis indicate multiple sources of lode mineralization. Based on regional ice flow directions and the stratigraphic and geographic locations of the gold samples, gold is likely sourced from epithermal and gold-rich porphyry deposits associated with the Ruby Range batholith, and orogenic mineralization in the Kluane schist.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2019-01-24 02:01:08","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
81648,"information","Evaluating geothermal potential in Yukon through temperature gradient drilling","As part of the Canadian government’s commitment to establishing clean energy in the North, the Yukon Geological Survey is collecting subsurface temperature data near communities in the southern part of the territory. The research is a collaborative effort among federal and territorial geoscientists, universities, First Nation governments, and geothermal consultants. A major goal of the project is to determine whether ground temperatures warrant further geothermal exploration in the territory. The study also presents an opportunity for Yukon Geological Survey to educate the public about geothermal energy. This paper summarizes the methods and results of the drilling of two ~500 m geothermal temperature gradient wells. The first was drilled in the fall of 2017 in the Whitehorse area, near Takhini Hot Springs, where a surface water seep measures 46°C. The second well was drilled in winter 2018 in the Tintina fault system, near Ross River. Results to date suggest warm fluids and possible permeable rocks in the Takhini well between 450 and 500 m from surface, and a higher than average geothermal gradient of ~31°C/km in the Tintina Trench near Ross River. The results do not indicate temperatures for power generation at economic depths, however, they are encouraging enough to warrant further geothermal studies in southern Yukon.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2019-01-24 02:01:59","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

These rocks host more than 40 Mt of polymetallic resources in numerous occurrences and styles of volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralization. Geochemical data from these rocks support previous interpretations that volcanism and plutonism occurred in arc–marginal arc (e.g., Fire Lake formation) and continental back-arc basin environments (e.g., Kudz Ze Kayah formation, Wind Lake formation, and Wolverine Lake group) where felsic magmatism formed from varying mixtures of crust and mantle-derived material. The rocks have elevated high field strength element (HFSE) and rare earth element (REE) concentrations in VMS-proximal stratigraphy relative to VMS-barren assemblages, suggesting that the petrogenetic conditions that generated felsic rocks likely played a role in the localization of VMS mineralization. Future work aims to constrain magmatic processes and outline prospectivity criteria for delineating productive VMS assemblages within the district, and in similar geodynamic settings globally.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2019-01-24 02:01:43","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

This paper uses historic YCGC data to summarize gold distribution characteristics in Hunker Creek and builds upon previously published summaries of YCGC data. Attributes of 1005 YCGC drill holes and shafts along lower Hunker Creek and a short section of the Klondike River were digitized, compiled, and analyzed in a Geographical Information System (GIS).

The exposed base of the Faro Peak formation includes argillite and organized to disorganized sandstone units that crop out southwest of the Yukon-Tanana–Slide Mountain terrane boundary near Faro. Lower Faro Peak formation units have mafic-intermediate volcanic provenance and were deposited by concentrated density flows or turbidity currents. The upper Faro Peak formation contains massive, disorganized conglomerate and sandstone units that were sourced from the Yukon-Tanana and Slide Mountain terranes and deposited by non-turbulent debris or density flows.

95818,"information","New mineral potential mapping methodology for Yukon: Case studies from the Beaver River and Dawson regional land use planning areas.","Territory-wide mineral potential mapping in Yukon was last conducted 18 years ago. An updated suite of maps for land use planning is, therefore, necessary. The YGS has developed a new GIS-based mapping process for this purpose. Industry-based applications using the new method will be developed going forward.

The approach makes use of mineral system components that potentially contribute to metal accumulations in an area. The method is a hybrid between a classic data-driven probabilistic approach and an expert-driven fuzzy logic approach. It is non-specific in terms of commodity  and/or deposit type – however, the claim and assessment report footprint data that are integral  to the mapping process capture these important components.

The procedure makes use of block modeling techniques where each block is assigned a prospectivity and (bedrock mapping) confidence score. Calculations are based on the presence or absence of categorical features within unit cells, and the scores represent the posterior favourability of each cell. Evidential layers are weighted according to buffer distance and/or through the application of knowledge-based factors. Lithology classes are factored using a multiclass weights-of-evidence approach.

Mineral potential and confidence scores are converted to either a 1, 2 or 3 according to a defined mathematical schema. The values are then combined – blocks with scores of 1:1 have the lowest mineral potential/lowest confidence whereas blocks with scores of 3:3 have the highest mineral potential/highest confidence. Nine possible combinations exist. Mineral potential maps containing measures of both potential and confidence are generated based on the cumulative contrast values.

Areas cut by major structures along which significant displacement has occurred need to be evaluated separately, and then stitched back together at the end of the assessment process. Concurrently, the mineral potential data need to be leveled to account for prospectivity differences across the structure concerned.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-01-16 01:01:15","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Locally, within the Bouvette Formation, calcareous, fossiliferous clastic rocks are interstratified with volcaniclastic and volcanic rocks. The volcanic rocks are inferred to be post-early Silurian based on preliminary fossil ages of graptolites found in underlying limestone. I propose extensional tectonism temporarily disrupted carbonate platform development in the early Silurian in this area. Crustal extension resulted in normal faulting and local subsidence. Thermal uplift, related to underplating of igneous bodies, resulted in subaerial exposure and subsequent erosion of chert, carbonate and volcanic rocks. Basins and slopes (areas between thermally uplifted blocks and subsiding areas) collected material eroding from exposed strata and volcanic rocks deposited during eruptions.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-01-16 01:01:52","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
95820,"information","Assessment of thermo-hydraulic properties of rock samples near Takhini Hot Springs, Yukon","The Takhini Hot Springs area north of Whitehorse, Yukon overlies a geothermal heat source that manifests as a 46°C water seep at surface. Despite its long-term use as a tourist swimming facility, the origins and geological setting of the hot spring remains poorly understood. The objective of this study is to assess the thermo-hydraulic properties of rock samples from drill core and outcrops near Takhini Hot Springs to better explain the presence of this hydrothermal system. A moderate rock thermal conductivity (average of ~3 W m-1 K-1) and a low matrix hydraulic conductivity for consolidated rocks (on the order of 10-9 m s-1) corresponding to a linear geothermal gradient of 16°C km-1 in the upper part of the Takhini well indicate conductive heat transfer between 50 and 450 m depth. Hydraulic conductivity of fractured and brecciated rocks on the order of 10-5  m s-1, and topographic contrasts affecting the hydrostatic pressure driving groundwater flow in the area suggest that forced convective heat transfer in the bottom of the Takhini well is responsible for the strong geothermal gradient of 250°C km-1 observed between 450 and 500 m depth. Steep faults appear to be a key pathway for deep groundwater to seep to surface and can explain the geothermal context in the vicinity of the Takhini well. Such a framework is a typical geothermal play type in orogenic belts. This research, therefore, helps to characterize the subsurface and provides critical information needed for a successful exploration of geothermal energy resources.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-01-16 01:01:08","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Here we report evidence for a protracted and complex magmatic-hydrothermal system typical of porphyry-epithermal deposits (e.g., multiple magmatic events, magma mingling, relevant vein-alteration types). In the Klaza area, there are at least four compositionally and texturally distinct intrusions interpreted as part of the Casino intrusive suite (ca. 80–76 Ma) that intrude granodiorite country rock of the Whitehorse suite (ca. 105 Ma). A ca. 72 Ma dike swarm (likely Prospector Mountain suite) was emplaced approximately 4–5 m.y. after emplacement of the Casino suite. Evidence of high-T hydrothermal activity consists of early dark micaceous (EDM) veins, sinuous and planar A-type veins, B-type, and D-type veins, and molybdenite-quartz veins. Composite epithermal-type sulphide veins cut high-T Cu-Au-Mo mineralization associated with phyllic and lesser potassic alteration assemblages. The age of porphyry-type mineralization is constrained by 187Re-187Os molybdenite dating to ca. 77 Ma (Kelly) and ca. 71 Ma (Cyprus). The 40Ar-39Ar muscovite dates from phyllic alteration in the Central Klaza zone yield ages of  ca. 77 Ma. These field observations, integrated with archival Cu-Au-assay data, suggest the Klaza epithermal veins are located in the phyllic alteration shell of a two-stage Cu-Au-Mo porphyry system. It is possible that the Klaza epithermal veins represent a Prospector Mountain-age porphyry–epithermal system overprinting a Casino-age porphyry system.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-01-16 01:01:34","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Orogenic mineralization and metamorphism is ca. 110 Ma to 100 Ma, and possibly as old as ca. 130 Ma. Following deformation and  regional metamorphism, two biotite-muscovite plutons, the Russell stock and Armstrong pluton, were emplaced at 95.39 ± 0.03 Ma and 95.51 ± 0.03 Ma, respectively. These plutons are here reassigned to the Tungsten suite based on mineralogy, chemistry and age. Coeval with these plutons are contact  metamorphism and possibly intrusion-related mineralization. Lead isotopic data from galena cluster into  two groups: Group 1 is enriched in thorogenic Pb with 206Pb/204Pb values between 18.31 and 18.14,  207Pb/204Pb between 15.62 and 15.55 and 208Pb/204Pb between 38.77 and 38.30.

We suggest that late Early Cretaceous mineralization is  related to large-scale orogenic fluids that tapped primitive (deep?) metal sources and early Late Cretaceous mineralization, coeval with local intrusions, sourced isotopically distinct metals from the intrusions. Alternatively, all mineralization could relate to Early Cretaceous orogenic fluids but with heterogeneous, locally derived metal sources and thermal resetting of Ar ages near the intrusions.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-01-16 01:01:06","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

95826,"information","Yukon Geological Survey: Planning for the future","The Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) had a busy year in 2019, welcoming seven new staff and initiating several new projects. In addition to its regular activities, the survey hosted a planning workshop with clients and stakeholders in April to identify gaps in Yukon’s geoscience knowledge base and engage participants in a discussion about their current and future information needs. The YGS holds these workshops every five years, and they are valuable for providing insights into research and exploration trends, generating ideas for new projects, and identifying opportunities for collaborative partnerships. As a backdrop for these discussions, participants were asked to consider how existing and emerging markets, climate change, societal needs and new technologies might influence how the YGS collects, manages and disseminates information.
This paper provides both a brief overview of 2019 program activities and a summary of what was heard at the April planning workshop. Workshop discussions covered a broad range of topics and included both specific project ideas as well as general themes. The YGS has already initiated some of the projects that were proposed in April. The paper is organized based on the thematic breakout sessions at the workshop; current activities underway under each of the themes are presented first, followed by a summary of the input heard at the workshop.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-01-17 10:01:31","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
95827,"information","Yukon placer mining 2019 development and exploration overview","The Yukon placer mining industry recorded strong production in 2019. This was largely due to favourable gold prices, coupled with a beneficial exchange rate, which resulted in high selling prices during most of the summer. The industry also benefited from an early start to the season due to warm early spring temperatures. Shifts in regional production values reflect movement of certain large operations to both new and historic locations. The shift reflects permitting challenges in the Indian River, as well as the need to discover and develop new deposits based on diminishing resources within specific claim holdings.

Placer gold production, according to export tax reporting at the time of publication, was 75,228 crude ounces and valued at $116M¿CDN. The 2019 production value was nearly $27M¿CDN greater than that of 2018, largely owing to a favourable gold price that averaged more than $1900¿CDN/fine ounce throughout much of the mining season. This was nearly $400¿CDN/fine ounce more than the average 2018 gold price. When accounting for inflation, the 2019 production value is the highest value since 1988.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-01-17 10:01:40","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

95829,"information","Yukon hard rock mining, development and exploration overview 2019","Yukon mineral exploration activity dipped slightly in 2019. Exploration expenditures were approximately $105 million, compared to $120 million in 2018. Development expenditures are estimated at $240 million, primarily for the development of Victoria Gold Corp.’s Eagle mine ($183M), and, to a lesser extent the advancement of Newmont Goldcorp.’s Coffee gold project and the reopening of the Minto gold-copper-silver mine by Pembridge Resources. Production dollars are attributable to operations at Victoria Gold’s new Eagle mine and the newly reopened Minto mine of Pembridge Resources plc.

The number of active exploration projects dropped significantly from 155 projects in 2018 to  80 projects in 2019. To some degree, this reflects the continuing tight equity markets. Thirty-six of the 80 projects spent more than $1M, while 44 projects spent less than $500,000. The majority of smaller projects received Yukon Mineral Exploration Program (YMEP) grant funding. In terms of all Yukon projects, gold continues to be the most sought-after commodity, with 68% of the projects targeting it. The remainder of projects focused on exploring for lead-zinc, copper, silver, or nickel-PGEs, and to a lesser extent, tin, cobalt or vanadium.

Claim staking in 2019 was down significantly over the previous year to 2212 claims. The number of claims in good standing is 173,161, down from an all-time high of 252,902 in 2012.

The study area for this project is located near the community of Burwash Landing and straddles the eastern Denali fault zone. The aim of this project is to analyze and interpret a variety of pre-existing and newly-acquired geological and geophysical data sets to identify favourable subsurface targets for a shallow, exploratory geothermal drilling program that could take place in the future. The geoscience work accomplished here includes both 2D map interpretation as well as construction of a 3D geologic model that was tested by geophysical inversion modelling of gravity and magnetic survey data. In addition, a literature review was conducted to identify analogous geothermal structural environments located in similar crustal-scale transform fault zones for comparison with geothermal systems that may be present in the vicinity of the Denali fault. Importantly, geophysical data from this study discovered a  right-step in the Denali fault that has the appropriate orientation to form a small pull-apart zone in the Earth’s crust within the project area south of Duke River. Such crustal extension may generate fractures and permeability in rocks in the subsurface. Subsurface permeability in geothermal systems provides the pathway for hot geothermal fluids to ascend to drillable depths. This study has identified seven drilling targets, all located in the vicinity of the previously mentioned right-step in the Denali fault. The 3D geologic model generated for this study was utilized to help understand the lithologic domains and structures likely to be encountered by the proposed exploratory boreholes. The distribution of temperature in the subsurface, however, remains a significant unknown. Regional-scale, Curie point depth estimates suggest an average geothermal gradient of ~40°C/km near the eastern Denali fault, but drilling is required to measure actual subsurface temperatures. Based upon the encouraging results of this study, it is recommended that at least two of the seven targets are drilled to depths of 500–1000 m  to obtain data on subsurface temperatures, fluids and geology.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Curie point depth,geologic modelling","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-05-28 02:05:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

95840,"information","Assessment of the thermo-hydraulic properties of rock samples near Takhini Hot Springs and in the Tintina fault zone, Yukon","As part of an emerging program to understand ground temperature and geothermal heat potential in Yukon, the Yukon Geological Survey drilled two temperature gradient wells in south-central Yukon: one near the Takhini Hot Springs in 2017, and a second in the Tintina Trench in 2018. This study presents the thermo-hydraulic properties of drill core from these wells and from selected outcrops, to evaluate heat transfer mechanisms in the subsurface and provide a heat flow model to characterize the geothermal potential of these regions. Thermo-hydraulic properties of the rocks in the Takhini well have a moderate thermal conductivity and a low matrix hydraulic conductivity for consolidated rocks, corresponding to a linear geothermal gradient in the upper part of the well.  The rocks in the Tintina well have low thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity. The linear geothermal gradient indicates conductive heat transfer even though the rocks are permeable. The proximity of the well to a mountain range suggests a shallow groundwater path in the Tintina well area, with no evidence of surface hot springs.
The location of steep faults appears to be a key pathway for deep groundwater to seep to surface and can explain the geothermal context near the Takhini well. Such a framework is a typical geothermal play type in orogenic belts. Although the Tintina well is found in a similar setting, this study does not identify potential for deep forced convective groundwater flow movements because hydraulic head difference along the faults may not be enough for the deep groundwater to rise since the faults are expected to be subvertical. This research, therefore, helps to characterize the subsurface and provides critical information needed for a successful exploration of geothermal energy resources.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,geothermal","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2020-07-20 02:07:01","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The Village of Carmacks spans the Yukon River valley at the mouth of the Nordenskiöld River and the landscape reflects the areas recent glacial and post-glacial history. About 16¿000 years ago, a large glacier melted in the vicinity leaving behind a complex topography of undulating hills and depressions. This was subsequently eroded through by the Yukon River, and large gravel terraces formed, providing a foundation for the community. Natural changes to the landscape continue and these changes can present public safety hazards and risks to current and future development projects. This map and associated hazard assessment provides the necessary baseline information to make informed land use decisions through identifying which areas of the community are most susceptible to landscape hazards. The most common hazards present in the community include, river erosion and flooding, landslides, and permafrost. It is our goal to provide Yukon communities with accurate geological knowledge concerning these natural processes, with the hope they are referenced in all future planning.

Relative to most regions of Canada, Yukon has fared relatively well and by June, the minerals sector was focused on how they could undertake exploration rather than how they might recover from a cancelled field season. Similarly, YGS managed to complete most of its planned field activities (albeit with a reduced scope), and to administer an expanded Yukon Mineral Exploration Program.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2021-01-18 07:01:22","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

In Yukon, the tourism industry nearly vanished overnight as flights and RV traffic were reduced to a trickle. Fortunately, gold mining was given an essential service “green light” to continue, amid strict protocols to control the spread of the virus. The industry responded with an incredible year of production, spurred on by high gold prices and low fuel costs. This scenario, where gold mining provided a safe haven and economic opportunity during global hard times, has played out before in Canadian history. The great depression of the late 1800s contributed significantly to interest in the Klondike Gold Rush, the dirty 1930s saw a resurgence in placer gold mining in Yukon, and similarly, the recession of the early 1980s kick started the modern era of placer gold mining in the territory. The story of the 2020 pandemic is no different, highlighting the value of economic diversification and ability of a remote northern industry to contribute new wealth to a nation when it is needed most.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2021-01-18 07:01:21","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Detailed information on project modules and levels of funding can be found in the YMEP guidebooks (https://yukon.ca/en/mineral-exploration-funding).","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2021-01-18 07:01:14","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
95893,"information","Yukon hard rock mining, development and exploration  overview 2020","Yukon mineral exploration activity was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions early in the year. As the summer began, exploration and mining companies were able to adjust their operating procedures and develop plans to allow them to adapt to the new reality. Companies implemented measures such as limiting the number of persons in camps, hiring local Yukon-based employees and contractors, increasing work rotation times so that employees spent less time in self-isolation, arranging for hotels to be used for self-isolation centres, having self-isolation spaces and procedures in camps and limiting the number of non-project personnel on site. These measures were crucial in turning around what was looking like a bleak exploration season and allowing for some sense of normalcy.
An increase in precious and base metal prices in mid-summer provided a much-needed shot in the arm for junior exploration companies. Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) tracks mineral sector spending through press releases, SEDAR and correspondence with companies. Although spending projections were dire at the start of the field season, by year-end, exploration expenditures are expected to be between $70 and $80M (vs. $117M in 2019). Development expenditures for the year are expected to be $65M, down from $225M in 2019. The drop in development expenditures is primarily due to the completion of construction at Victoria Gold Corp.’s Eagle Gold mine. Year end metal production for 2020 is approximately $300M with production coming from Eagle Gold, Minto and the newly re-opened Keno Hill mines.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2021-01-18 07:01:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Limited structural observations on the eastern flank of the Richardson anticlinorium indicate that the strain intensity increases significantly close to major faults that are associated with deformation zones tens to hundreds of metres wide. A predominant dextral sense of motion is documented for several major faults belonging to the Richardson fault array. However, second-order features exhibit highly variable kinematics. In several cases, strike-slip faults cut shallower dipping faults and follow steep bedding planes, suggesting that dextral motion occurred in a previously deformed and tilted sedimentary succession. The amount of displacement along the Richardson fault array is poorly constrained. Further investigation is warranted as potential large displacements may bear significant consequences on palinspastic reconstructions.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2021-01-18 02:01:17","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Whole rock lithogeochemical data are presented from analyses of core from three drillholes at the Tom property.  The core covers intervals ranging from the Middle Devonian Road River Group (Sapper Formation) to the Upper Devonian Earn Group (Portrait Lake Formation–Fuller Lake Member) and includes the Macmillan Pass volcanic suite that occurs at the Road River–Earn Group contact. Samples were collected to characterize the depositional history of Middle–Upper Devonian fine-grained rocks in the region to aid with paleogeographical reconstructions, depositional models, improve age control and to aid in correlation of thick shale units. Baseline geochemical profiles and sedimentology for all fine-grained units indicate turbidity current deposition in a range of shelf to basinal settings and variable oxic to anoxic conditions. Additionally, eleven existing Middle Devonian conodont collections were re-examined to provide better biozone refinements and a tighter constraint of the contact between the Road River Group (Sapper Formation) and Earn Group (Portrait Lake Formation) to the Late Eifelian australis-ensensis biozones.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2021-01-18 02:01:58","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The Seagull suite comprises ultra-fractionated, A-type granites dated at ca. 103–101 Ma that have anomalous average heat production values (A) of 7.9 to 9.9 µW/m3. The Teslin suite is older (ca. 121–109 Ma) and characterized by more intermediate granodiorite compositions that mostly have average A values of 2.0 µW/m3, closer to global averages. Locally, anomalous A values of 4.5 to 11.4 µW/m3 are associated with younger (ca. 110–108 Ma), more evolved granitic phases of the Teslin suite. The 3D inversion of Bouguer gravity data provides models that constrain the subsurface density character and extents of the Hake and Seagull batholiths, and estimated volumes of ~4624 and 2744 km3, respectively. The combination of these results suggests that potential heat energy of ~36.5 MWt may be contained in the Hake batholith, and as much as 27.2 MWt in the Seagull batholith.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,geothermal","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2021-01-18 02:01:48","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

The sediment types include till, glaciofluvial sand and gravel, glaciolacustrine silt, fluvial sand and gravel, and eolian sand. Average radon concentrations were compared to bedrock lithology, thickness of surficial sediment, surficial sediment type, surficial sediment grain size distribution, sorting, sediment maturity, and soil moisture to determine the first-order geological controls. Pronounced interseasonal variation was observed, but intraseasonal summer readings were relatively consistent. Positive correlation is apparent between radon concentration and grain size distribution, as well as between radon concentration and soil moisture. Negative correlation is observed between radon concentration and sediment maturity, with till and weathered bedrock displaying the highest concentrations of radon. No appreciable correlation was observed with depth to bedrock or with bedrock type.

These measures also allowed the operating mines to continue to ramp-up production.
Precious and base metal prices fluctuated throughout the year as pandemic and supply chain related issues affected markets, but generally prices remained elevated. Expectations are that year-end exploration expenditures in Yukon will be approximately $113 million ($75.8 million in 2020). Development expenditures for the year are expected to be $71.5 million, up from $53.9 million in 2020. The value of year-end hard rock metal production for 2021 is expected to be approximately $500 million, thanks to the continued ramp up of production at the Eagle Gold mine, the restart of mining at Keno and continued operations at Minto.
The number of active exploration projects dropped slightly from 106 in 2020 to 91 projects in 2021. Twenty-six of the 91 projects spent more than $1 million, while 44 projects spent less than $500 000. Many of the smaller projects received Yukon Mineral Exploration Program (YMEP) grant funding.

It examines the interactions between the lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and atmosphere – all of which are critical to sustaining our planet (AGI, 2012). The Yukon Geological Survey’s mandate is to provide objective geological information to Yukon government, Yukon First Nations and the general public. This information underpins geoscience-related policy and investment decisions in the territory, and adds value to Yukon’s geoscience knowledge base. With a staff of more than 15 geoscientists, the Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) conducts a wide variety activities from traditional bedrock and surficial mapping, to focused studies such as community hazards mapping (e.g., monitoring landslides and thawing permafrost), and mineral assessments, among others. As a government organization, it is our duty to not only engage with First Nations and other governments, but to also educate all citizens of the Yukon about the importance of geoscience in order to help society find and manage our natural resources for the present and future (Geoscientists Canada, 2018).
YGS recognizes the importance of having a geoscientist on staff who is dedicated to outreach and education. Communicating geoscience effectively, and educating Yukoners on how Earth systems work will help them to make informed judgements that affect our territory, as well as our planet (AGI, 2011). Despite the ongoing pandemic, YGS remained very active in public outreach and education; this paper provides a summary of activities for 2021.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-02-03 09:02:41","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Since the release of the earlier paper, a number of the methods have been modified, and new techniques introduced. These are incorporated into this update paper — the reader is referred to the earlier paper for details of the method itself.
Mineral potential maps have thus far been completed for the Beaver River watershed, and the Dawson, Teslin, Na-Cho Nyäk Dun, and Ross River regions. There have been significant updates made to the mineral potential mapping method:
1. Modifications to buffer distance and factors (these are an important fuzzy logic (i.e., non-Boolean) component of the mineral potential mapping process) to enhance mapping outcomes.
2. The introduction of an in-house generated, machine learning algorithm (unsupervised, clustering-type) to classify mineral potential in order to remove the potential for human bias. The method replaces the statistical, areas-under-the-curve approach used previously.
3. A new method for delineating anomalous stream sediment data based on the lithological makeup of each watershed basin. The method computes and compares expected assay values to actual assay values, with values exceeding a certain threshold taken as anomalous. The previous method did not take lithology into account, relying on simple percentile methods only, and was considered insufficiently robust.
4. A new method for categorizing mineral potential confidence. Mineral potential maps produced by the Geological Survey contain measures of bedrock mapping confidence to facilitate land use planning. The updated method is significantly more robust than that used previously.
5. Revisions to the map legend to account for the new, machine learning-based mineral potential categorization methodology.
6. Revisions to the map colour scheme to make them colour blind-safe.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-02-18 09:02:56","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

95940,"information","Preliminary results and structural interpretations from drone lidar surveys over the Eastern Denali fault, Yukon","The Yukon Geological Survey and Kluane First Nation intend to drill a temperature gradient well near Burwash Landing, YT, to evaluate the geothermal energy potential of the area. The preferred drill site is located immediately southwest of the Eastern Denali fault (EDF), which has ruptured multiple times in the Holocene. The kinematics and recent activity of the fault are important factors to consider when developing a geothermal resource, for two purposes: 1. identifying zones of enhanced permeability due to local fault geometry and 2. assessing the seismic hazard of drilling and developing a geothermal system along an active fault. Here, we present new lidar data collected from a drone platform, which enabled the production of 30 cm spatial resolution bare-earth Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) over several segments of the EDF. These products offer a considerable increase in both spatial resolution and canopy penetration compared to existing spaceborne and airborne photogrammetric Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and DTMs of the area. We use hillshades to map segments of the EDF surface trace in detail, and we make preliminary interpretations about the structure and kinematics of the fault. Offset stream channels and hill slopes that cross the fault at high angles indicate dextral offsets ranging between 5 and 75 m. Vertical separation ranges between 0 and 20 m, varying between northeast and southwest-side up. We confirm previous interpretations that the geothermal drill site is located at a minor releasing bend in the fault. Previous fault maps based on ArcticDEM data showed multiple fault splays parallel to the EDF at the geothermal drill site, whereas the lidar data indicate strain is concentrated to a singular fault plane in this area. The EDF is characterized by a series of sediment mounds that we interpret to be positive flower structures. The higher spatial resolution achieved by the drone reveals possible compressional structures (fault tips or folds) consistent with dextral transpression on the surface of these mounds. We recommend additional drone lidar acquisition, field studies, geophysical analysis, and kinematic modeling to be carried out over the coming year.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-02-18 09:02:47","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
95941,"information","Surficial geochemical setting of the southern Carmacks-Minto copper belt","Preliminary surficial geological investigations of the southern Carmacks-Minto copper belt (NTS 115I/7) include material thicknesses, distribution and observations of thermal conditions. The Quaternary setting is discussed in relationship to material genesis and geomorphological processes operating on the landscape. Surficial material distribution is controlled by ice flow direction, prevailing wind direction and aspect-related differences in gravity and thermal-driven surficial processes.
Valley bottoms and north-facing slopes have moderate to thick surficial cover that include far travelled sediments such as till, loess and glaciolacustrine sand. Drainage can be poor in these
landscapes and permafrost is present in many areas. Valley bottoms contain thick Quaternary fill and are unsuitable for traditional soil surveys. North-facing slopes may provide good geochemical results if sampled carefully for first-order bedrock derivatives. Upland and south-facing slopes have thin to moderate surficial cover and can provide good conditions for traditional C-horizon soil sampling surveys. Windblown sand, silt and volcanic ash are deposited thickly, but unevenly, across the landscape. These sediments dilute surficial geochemical samples and are often incorporated into other materials through cryoturbation, and fluvial and gravitational reworking. Geochemical dilution by eolian materials is more significant near the Yukon River floodplain and in the central Carmacks-Minto copper belt.
Future surficial geochemical surveys should use a variety of methods suited to landscape characteristics and well-described surficial material characterizations. Applying surficial landscape models to existing soils data may also improve their utility for exploration. High quality surficial mapping is a critical part of surficial geochemical surveys and new products in this area will benefit from the use of airborne lidar.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-02-18 09:02:45","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
95942,"information","Geology of the Carpenter Creek and McKay Hill areas (NTS 106D/6, 11), central Yukon","The Carpenter Creek area straddles the Paleozoic basin-platform transition which is coincident with the Dawson thrust in north-central Yukon. North of the thrust, the strata can be broadly divided into two groups: (1) Proterozoic sedimentary and intrusive rocks, and (2) Paleozoic platformal strata with volcanic rock horizons. The two groups of rocks are separated by an angular unconformity. Below the unconformity, Hart River gabbro sills and dikes (ca. 1.38 Ga) intrude the Gillespie Lake Group. Younger Proterozoic rocks that are not intruded by the gabbro occur on the other side of a fault that traces through the Carpenter Creek valley. These rocks are interpreted to be younger than Gillespie Lake Group and are tentatively assigned to Pinguicula Group. Above the unconformity, Paleozoic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks are interstratified with carbonate rocks. The volcanic rocks occur near the base and top of the Bouvette Formation.
South of the Dawson thrust, in its direct hangingwall, volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks are interlayered with shale, chert and sandstone and intruded by discontinuous gabbro bodies of unknown age. Rare limestone lenses within the volcanic rocks contain coral fossils that constrain the age of these rocks to Middle Ordovician or younger. Hyland Group rocks are thrust over the volcanic unit and comprise shale, quartz grit and limestone. Shale exhibits a well-developed foliation, oriented parallel to the northwest-trending structural grain. Tight folds with NW-SE striking axial planes repeats stratigraphy south of the Dawson thrust.
Within the mapped area, Ag-Pb-Zn ± Au mineralization near Grey Copper Hill occurs right along the unconformity between Upper (?) Proterozoic rocks and the Bouvette Formation (Figs. 1 and 2). Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-mineralization is spatially associated with a strike-slip fault that offsets shale, volcanic rocks and small gabbro bodies near McKay Hill (Figs. 1 and 2).","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-02-18 10:02:00","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Here we report eight new U-Pb zircon crystallization ages, two CA-TIMS and six LA-ICPMS, and Pb isotopic data for igneous feldspar from six samples. A 199.06 ± 0.96 Ma crystallization age demonstrates the host rock to the Brown-McDade deposit is the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Minto suite.

These ages confirm a mid-Cretaceous Whitehorse suite affinity for these rocks with porphyritic textures suggesting high-level emplacement. Feldspar Pb isotopic data of igneous rocks in the Mount Nansen area become more radiogenic with time and are distinct for Late Triassic to Early Jurassic plutonic rocks versus Cretaceous rocks.

A newly mapped area, centred on the Boswell River, is divided into three structural panels by two regional-scale discontinuities, the Little Bear fault and the Sidney Creek fault.
The panel on the northeastern side of the Little Bear fault includes units dominated by metasedimentary rocks (Slate Mountain succession), mafic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (Wiley succession), and a varied metasedimentary/metavolcaniclastic unit (Livingstone Creek succession). Each of these is crosscut by intermediate-mafic intrusions of the Simpson Range suite and is therefore Early Mississippian or older. Fossiliferous limestone is interpreted to unconformably overlie phyllite of the Slate Mountain succession. Other units that crop out in this region are Permian augen schist and Cretaceous plutons, including Late Cretaceous quartz monzonite that hosts the Red Mountain Mo porphyry deposit.
The central part of the area, between the Little Bear and Sidney Creek faults, is dominated by mafic volcanic and plutonic rocks of the Sawtooth succession. These are along strike from, and provisionally correlated with the Moose formation of the Boswell assemblage. The Sawtooth succession is overlain by a carbonate and chert-bearing metasedimentary unit (Rosy succession), which hosts a small foliated metagranodiorite intrusion. A younger, as yet undated, mafic metavolcanic unit (Gunsight succession) is locally preserved above the Rosy succession. The metagranodiorite in the Rosy succession formed ca. 336 Ma and underwent metamorphic zircon growth in the Early Jurassic (~195 Ma). This zircon growth is interpreted to have accompanied regional, epidote-amphibolite to amphibolite-facies metamorphism and deformation.
Mississippian rocks of the Simpson Range suite dominate much of the southwestern domain. These intrusions crosscut quartzose schist, graphitic phyllite and metabasaltic rocks of the Flat Creek succession, which also hosts Middle Triassic metagabbro.
All pre-Jurassic rocks in the area are deformed, while post-tectonic intrusions include members of the Early Jurassic Lokken suite, the mid-Cretaceous Quiet Lake batholith and Iron Creek stock, and the aforementioned Red Mountain suite. Most Early Jurassic intrusions are undeformed, but deformation/hydration of some minor phases suggests they were intruded during the waning stages of deformation.
The Sidney Creek fault is cut by the Early Jurassic Sawtooth stock while the Cretaceous Iron Creek stock intruded across the trace of the Little Bear fault. The Little Bear and Sidney Creek faults are interpreted to define tectonic boundaries between Yukon-Tanana terrane and rocks of the Semenof block and may form part of a regional detachment between these units.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-02-18 10:02:00","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

A synthesis of the extensive data set for these plutons supports interpretation of the magmatic and tectonic evolution of the northern Intermontane terranes. Late Triassic juvenile plutons that locally intrude the Yukon-Tanana terrane represent the northern extension of arc magmatism within Stikinia. Early Jurassic plutons that intrude Stikinia and Yukon-Tanana terranes were emplaced during crustal thickening (200–195 Ma) and subsequent exhumation (190–178 Ma). The syn-collisional magmatism migrated to the south and shows increasing crustal contributions with time. This style of magmatism in Yukon contrasts with coeval, juvenile arc magmatism in British Columbia (Hazelton Group), that records southward arc migration in the Early Jurassic. Exhumation and subsidence of the WT in the north were probably linked to the retreating Hazelton arc by a sinistral transform. East of WT, Early Jurassic plutons intruded into Yukon-Tanana record continued arc magmatism in Quesnellia. Middle Jurassic plutons were intruded after final enclosure of the Cache Creek terrane and imbrication of the Intermontane terranes. The post-collisional plutons have juvenile isotopic compositions that, together with stratigraphic evidence of surface uplift, are interpreted to record asthenospheric upwelling and lithospheric delamination. A revised tectonic model proposes that entrapment of the Cache Creek terrane was the result of Hazelton slab rollback and development of a sinistral transform fault system linked to the collision zone to the north.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-02-23 09:02:15","2025-06-16 01:06:31","",""

The map area straddles the Pleistocene glacial limits that formed the eastern margin of Beringia during glacial periods. As a result, the landforms of this region are diverse and reflect the contrasting geomorphology characteristic of glaciated versus unglaciated terrain. Importantly, work in this region filled a significant gap in our knowledge of central Yukon glacial limits and how adjacent landscapes were impacted by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.
Our goal was to produce an in depth description of the region’s surficial geology that is applicable for a wide range of purposes. While this region is remote, there is growing interest in its mineral endowment, specifically in the Dawson Range, east of the White River, and in the Ruby Range. Knowledge of the surficial geology can be employed in exploration geochemistry programs to improve sampling and can assist in placer exploration. Future development in the region will also benefit from this work by providing a framework on terrain hazards, such as permafrost and landslides, and construction materials like aggregate. From a land use planning perspective, the surficial sediments and associated soils are an important control on the region’s biogeography and therefore, habitat.

Burwash Landing in Yukon is prospective for geothermal energy based on a high geothermal gradient, local occurrence of warm groundwater and proximity to the active, crustal-scale Denali fault. Uncertainties about the potential geothermal system include the nature and geometry of fluid pathways, and heat sources required to drive a hydrothermal system. In this study,
we inverted three passive electromagnetic datasets—321 extremely low frequency electromagnetic, 33 audiomagnetotelluric and 51 magnetotelluric stations—to map the subsurface electrical structure to 8 km depth. Our new model reveals vertical conductive structures associated with the two main faults, Denali and Bock’s Creek, which we interpret to represent fluid-deposited graphite and hydrothermal alteration, respectively. Our model supports an interpreted releasing bend on the main Denali fault strand. This is associated with the deepest conductivity anomaly along the fault and potential for deeper penetration of fluids. Enigmatic conductive bodies from 1 to > 6 km depth are associated with intermediate to mafic intrusions. Fluids released from these bodies may advect heat and provide a possible heat source to mobilize hot fluids and sustain a geothermal system in the region.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,3D interpretation,Denali fault,geothermal,magnetotelluric,resistivity","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-11-25 10:11:46","2024-05-29 10:05:44","",""

95965,"information","Analysis of geoscience data for geothermal exploration along the Tintina fault near Watson Lake, Yukon","In collaboration with the Yukon Geological Survey, Liard First Nation and other project partners, Innovate Geothermal Ltd. performed an analysis of geoscience data in southeastern Yukon as part of an effort to better understand the potential for geothermal energy resources that, if present, could be utilized to help reduce fossil fuel use in off-grid communities. The study area for this project is located near the Town of Watson Lake and straddles the crustal-scale Tintina fault zone. The main aim of this project is to analyze and interpret a variety of pre-existing and newly-acquired geological and geophysical datasets to evaluate whether geothermal reservoirs may be present within the study area. A secondary aim is to propose favourable drilling locations, if warranted, for exploratory wells to collect information on subsurface temperature and permeability. The geoscience work accomplished here includes both 2D map interpretation as well as construction of a 3D geologic model that was guided by geophysical inversion modelling of gravity, magnetic and magnetotelluric survey data. In the study area, the distribution of temperature in the subsurface remains a significant unknown; however, limited evidence suggests subsurface temperatures are modest. Regional-scale, Curie point depth estimates suggest an average geothermal gradient of only ~31°C/km. In contrast, two oil and gas exploration wells from the 1960s located 15–35 km outside the study area give a geothermal gradient range of ~38–50°C/km. Drilling is required to measure actual subsurface temperature gradients in the vicinity of Watson Lake. Evidence for substantial subsurface permeability is generally lacking in the study area. Analysis of the geoscience data did not reveal any specific locations along the Tintina fault that suggest a structural environment favourable for subsurface fracture permeability. Furthermore, the Tintina fault presents little evidence of active tectonism. Active tectonism helps maintain open fractures in the fault zone which could facilitate deep circulation of fluids to form a natural geothermal system. A lack of active tectonism could limit permeability in the fault zone. In addition, geophysical modelling suggests that large portions of the Watson Lake study area are likely underlain by shale-rich bedrock. This type of rock has very low permeability and is not favourable for maintaining open fractures. The only evidence for subsurface permeability found in this study is sand layers in the Cenozoic sedimentary rock of the Tintina trough. These sand layers could be permeable but are interbedded with low permeability layers such as silt and clay; the thickness and lateral extent of the sand layers is unknown. The 3D geologic model developed in this study suggests that the Cenozoic sedimentary rock of the Tintina trough is limited to less than ~1 km thick. This implies that fluids residing in sand layers in this rock unit would have a maximum temperature of between ~38 and 50°C. Geothermal fluids at these temperatures could potentially be utilized to help heat buildings in the community of Upper Liard. Many unknowns regarding the temperature and permeability of the subsurface still exist in the Watson Lake study area. The location of a 1 km deep scientific research well is proposed to help answer many of the remaining questions. However, considering the lack of evidence for bedrock permeability in the study area, other approaches to utilizing the Earth’s heat, such as Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES) systems, could be considered to help the community of Watson Lake reduce dependence on fossil fuels for residential heating.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2022-12-29 10:12:37","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

In this study, we perform double-difference relocation to the USGS earthquake catalogue for this region to produce a relocated catalogue of 5536 seismic events above magnitude 1.5 from 2010–2021. The relocated catalogue demonstrates better spatial resolution of linear features and the removal of grid location artifacts in depth. The relocated catalogue has smaller travel time residuals and smaller residual standard deviations showing that the new catalogue has improved absolute locations. From bootstrapping, we estimate the location uncertainties for the relocated events to be on the order of 1.2–2.4 km in the horizontal direction and 1.5–2.1 km in the vertical direction. From the relocated events, we interpret new faults including a fault connecting the Totschunda and Denali faults, a connector fault between the Totschunda-Duke River fault system and the Fairweather fault, and multiple smaller faults connecting the Fairweather and Denali faults. The significantly reduced uncertainty in depth also permits constraining the seismicity predominantly to the uppermost 10 km of the crust.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2023-01-19 01:01:44","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""

Fractures in the Duke River area are described based on 36 scanlines collected across 9 rock types from 0.8 to 22 km from the Denali fault. The majority of fractures are steeply dipping but have no preferential strike. The linear fracture intensity is high, and most fractures range from open to moderately wide. These attributes vary slightly by lithology but can be grouped into distinct hydrostratigraphic units. The distance from the Denali fault has a non-linear influence on fracture intensity and aperture and a negligible effect on fracture spacing and length.

In this work, we leverage recent improvements in station coverage to estimate focal mechanisms for small and moderate-magnitude (M ≥ 2.0) earthquakes from P-wave first-motion polarity data. We invert these data using a probabilistic method that rigorously quantifies mechanism uncertainties. We present preliminary solutions for 363 events, which improve the spatial coverage of the focal mechanism catalogue for this region. We observe contrasting P-axis orientations for events on either side of the Fairweather fault. For events within southwestern Yukon, the distribution of faulting mechanism types and P-axis orientations are relatively consistent. Our focal mechanism solutions support the existence of an unmapped fault south of the Duke River fault.

The metatonalite has a sheet-like geometry and is in contact with contrasting metasedimentary successions. Overlying the metatonalite is the Slate Mountain succession, which includes quartzite, psammite, phyllite and limestone. The metatonalite overlies rocks of the Evelyn Creek succession (new), which has a tripartite stratigraphy; its lower part is dominated by chert and siliceous argillite, the middle unit comprises chlorite-muscovite schist and quartzite, while the upper unit is a prominent interval of pale coloured marble/calcsilicate. The contact between the Evelyn Creek succession and the overlying Mississippian metatonalite is interpreted to be structural rather than intrusive.

 the geoscience data shows evidence for a complex structural environment that appears favourable for subsurface fracture permeability in the Teslin fault zone area. In addition, geologic mapping and geophysical modelling suggests that large portions of the Teslin study area are underlain by quartzite and volcanic bedrock. Both rock types have a favourable potential for maintaining open fractures. Many unknowns regarding the temperature and permeability of the subsurface still exist in the Teslin study area. The location of a 500 m deep scientific research well is proposed to help answer many of the remaining questions.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Innovate Geothermal Ltd,geothermal exploration","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2023-09-07 08:09:42","2023-12-12 10:12:34","",""
95985,"information","Detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope signature of Carboniferous and older strata of the Yukon-Tanana terrane in Yukon, Canadian Cordillera: Implications for terrane correlations and the onset of Late Devonian arc magmatism","The Yukon-Tanana terrane in Yukon, Canada, records Late Devonian (ca. 366–360 Ma) rifting and the onset of latest Devonian–Carboniferous arc and back-arc magmatism (ca. 360–325 Ma) in the Northern Cordillera. Detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope analyses indicate that the metasedimentary basement of the Yukon-Tanana terrane was sourced in northwestern Laurentia. Sandstones in Late Devonian–Carboniferous successions generally have robust Late Devonian–Mississippian age peaks, and their Hf isotope signatures are characterized by strongly negative εHft values in Late Devonian zircons followed by progressively more juvenile εHft values in Carboniferous zircons. This Hf isotopic “pull-up” reflects the melting of Precambrian crust related to regional extension in the Late Devonian, followed by progressively more juvenile magmatism as the arc matured through the Carboniferous.

Paleozoic rocks of the Tracy Arm terrane in southeastern Alaska, USA (formerly Yukon-Tanana south), have been compared with the Yukon-Tanana terrane in Yukon. Detrital zircons from the metasedimentary basement to the Tracy Arm terrane have distinct Precambrian populations that indicate sources along a different segment of the Laurentian margin compared to basement of the Yukon-Tanana terrane. Magmatism in the Tracy Arm terrane ranges from 440 Ma to 360 Ma and is characterized by an Hf isotopic “pull-down” in the Silurian to Early Devonian, followed by a “pull-up” in the Middle to Late Devonian and a second “pull-down” in the Late Devonian to early Mississippian. Thus, the Yukon-Tanana and Tracy Arm terranes record distinct pre-Carboniferous histories. Interactions between these two terranes are suggested by the influx of exotic early Mississippian clasts and detrital zircons on the Tracy Arm terrane that match sources in the Yukon-Tanana terrane.

95986,"information","Early Ordovician seamounts preserved in the Canadian Cordillera: Implications for the rift history of western Laurentia","The breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia and development of the western Laurentian rifted margin are in part recorded by Neoproterozoic to mid-Paleozoic igneous and sedimentary rock successions in the Canadian Cordillera. New bedrock mapping and volcanic facies analysis of Early Ordovician mafic rocks assigned to the Menzie Creek Formation in central Yukon allow reconstruction of the depositional environment during the volcanic eruptions, whole-rock geochemical data constrain the melting depth and crust-mantle source regions of the igneous rocks within the study area, and zircon U-Pb age studies provide determination of the precise timing of submarine eruptions. Menzie Creek Formation volcanic rocks are interlayered with continental slope strata and show lithofacies consistent with those of modern seamount systems. Representative seamount facies contain several kilometers of hyaloclastite breccia and pillow basalt with rare sedimentary rocks. Menzie Creek Formation seamounts form a linear array parallel to the Twopete fault, an ancient extensional or strike-slip fault that localized magmatism along the nascent western Laurentian margin. Zircon grains from two volcanic successions yielded high-precision chemical abrasion–thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) dates of ca. 484 Ma (Tremadocian), which are interpreted as the age of eruption. Menzie Creek Formation rocks are alkali basalt and have oceanic-island basalt–like geochemical compositions. The whole-rock trace element and Nd-Hf isotope compositions are consistent with the partial melting of subcontinental lithospheric mantle at ~75–100 km depth. Post-rift, Early Ordovician seamounts in central Yukon record punctuated eruptive activity along a rift-related fault, the separation of a continental fragment from western Laurentia, or the oblique post-breakup kinematics from the counterclockwise rotation of Laurentia that facilitated local extension in the passive margin.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,absolute age,basalts,bedrock,cordillera,lower ordovician,menzie creek formation,ocean-island basalts,paleozoic,tectonics","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2023-11-14 03:11:44","2024-05-29 09:05:35","",""

The YGS had a challenging year in 2023. Wildfires and landslides punctuated the field season, disrupting field plans for some, and requiring work priorities to be adapted. Additionally, the survey had six staff members leave and two others were on extended absences, which had an impact on operations. Despite a reduced capacity, YGS staff continued to deliver on projects and fill client requests for information. Recruitment efforts are underway and YGS anticipates seeing growth in the coming year.

Looking forward, 2024 marks the start of the survey’s next five-year planning cycle.

96030,"information","Yukon hardrock mining, development and exploration overview 2023","Despite tough market conditions, the Yukon saw another year of significant exploration results and new discoveries. At the time of writing, Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) estimated exploration expenditures in the territory to be $147M for the year, based on company press releases, SEDAR (System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval Overview) postings and conversations with industry clients. This estimate is up 18% from $124M in 2022 (Fig.  1). Development expenditures for 2023 are estimated to be $95M (Fig. 1) and mineral production is estimated to be $495M (approximately 87% attributed to gold production, 10% to silver production and 3% to copper production), down from a total of $543M in 2022; Fig. 2).1 It was a challenging year for production due to the closure of the Minto mine and the two-week closure of Victoria Gold’s Eagle Gold mine due to wildfires in the Mayo region; however, strong precious and base-metal prices throughout the year, increased production at Eagle Gold mine, and the re-opening of the Keno Hill mine suggests that 2023 production revenue will remain strong.

There were 82 active exploration projects in the territory in 2023 (Fig. 3, Appendix 1), which was similar to 2022; however, the number of active companies and individual prospectors continues to
decline. The notable increase in exploration expenditures compared with 2022 can be attributed to the progression of several exploration projects into more advanced stages. In total, 31 companies
spent more than $500K on exploration and development; 19 of those spent more than $1M. Additionally, several companies were able to raise extra funding mid-season, which extended their initial proposed exploration programs. 

The primary commodity in terms of total exploration expenditures in the territory continues to be gold, representing 55% of spending ($80.5M), followed by zinc-lead (25%, $37.7M), silver (9%, $13.4M), copper (9%, $13.2M), tungsten (1%, $1.0M) and nickel-PGE (1%, $900K; Fig. 4). Gold exploration has dominated expenditures since the late 1980s, often representing upward of 80% of total expenditures; however, in recent years there has been a progressive shift to a more equal split between precious metal and critical mineral exploration expenditures. 

As of November 1, 2023, 5119 quartz claims had been staked in 2023 (Fig. 5). Most of the new claims were in the Mayo Mining District (60%), followed by the Whitehorse (25%) and Dawson (15%) mining districts; no new claims were staked in the Watson Lake Mining District (Fig. 6).

Currently, Burwash Landing relies on importing diesel for power and heating and would benefit from a reliable source of renewable energy. Our study uses horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) measurements from nine temporary broadband seismometers to refine shear-wave velocity models for the upper 500  m of the crust. These models constrain layering and structure within shallow sediments, depth to bedrock, and discontinuities within the bedrock. These results provide reliable estimates of the thickness of sedimentary cover overlying bedrock. Bedrock depths vary from 50 to 450 m, deepening to the northeast of the Denali fault, and follows a power-law increase with depth through sediments.

The objective of this study was to assess the geothermal potential of the Takhini Hot Springs area using 2D subsurface flow and heat transfer simulations to numerically replicate the observed temperature and gain a better understanding of heat transfer mechanisms affecting the geothermal resource. Inclined permeable layers such as contacts between fractured sedimentary units appear to facilitate groundwater circulation, creating a path for geothermal fluids to rise. A fault that is assumed to be subvertical is present in the area but does not impact the model’s water circulation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to define the impact of each model parameter on the hot springs temperature and on temperature profiles simulated in the Takhini well.

Despite notable historical seismicity and major regional faults, studies of the region between the Fairweather and Denali faults are complicated by glacial coverage and the remote setting. In the last decade, significant improvements have been made to the density of regional broadband seismometer networks. We relocate more than 5,000 earthquakes between 2010 and 2021 in the region of southeastern Alaska and southwestern Yukon utilizing these improved seismic networks. With reductions in catalog uncertainty, particularly in depth, we quantify the thickness of the seismogenic layer in the crust throughout the region and locate seismicity on a shallow network of upper-crustal faults. Relocated earthquakes, combined with an updated focal-mechanism catalog, permit estimating and classifying motion of active faults. This includes mapping the Totschunda-Fairweather “Connector” fault, which plays an important role in explaining regional deformation, and identifying new faults like the Kathleen Lake fault. We draw similarities between our seismic observations and simplified conceptual models of regional tectonics, which describe a dominant transpressional regime and localized slip partitioning. Our results support a hypothesis where current deformation is taking place on a well-defined and evolved network of shallow faults in the corridor between the Totschunda-Fairweather “Connector” and Denali faults.

Despite the high maturation of samples, the totalorganic carbon (TOC) content of the limestone unit averages 1.31 wt. % (maximum = 3.18 wt. %). Petrographic observations indicate that pore and fracture filling pyrobitumen is the dominant organic matter maceral in the studied samples. This type of pyrobitumen was matured after its emplacement,indicating that hydrocarbon fluids cannot have served as an agent for gold transport. Pyrobitumen disseminated in the rock or associated with stylolites are also documented. The correlation between TOC and Tl (the best proxy for Au) for selected samples and the high As content of pyrobitumen fillingpores may suggest a link between organic matter content and gold deposition, but this was not demonstrated by LA-ICP-MS micro-scale mapping. This study also highlights the challenges of establishing a direct spatial relationship between 'invisible' gold and very small (< 10 µm) pyrobitumenparticles.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2024-05-29 10:05:06","2024-05-29 10:05:24","",""
96047,"information","Retrogressive thaw slump susceptibility in the northern hemisphere permafrost region","Mean annual temperatures in the Arctic and subarctic have increased in recent decades, increasing the number of permafrost hazards. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs), triggered by the thawing of ground ice in permafrost soil, have become more common in the Arctic. Many studies report an increase in RTS activity on a local or regional scale. In this study, the primary goals are to: (i) examine the spatial patterns of the RTS occurrences across the circumpolar permafrost region, (ii) assess the environmental factors associated with their occurrence and (iii) create the first susceptibility map for RTS occurrence across the Northern Hemisphere. Based on our results, we predicted high RTS susceptibility in the continuous permafrost regions above the 60th latitude, especially in northern Alaska, north-western Canada, the Yamal Peninsula, eastern Russia and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The model indicated that air temperature and soil properties are the most critical environmental factors for the occurrence of RTSs on a circumpolar scale. Especially, the climatic conditions of thaw season were highlighted. This study provided new insights into the circumpolar susceptibility of ice-rich permafrost soils to rapid permafrost-related hazards like RTSs and the associated impacts on landscape evolution, infrastructure, hydrology and carbon fluxes that contribute to global warming.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,circumpolar susceptibility,mass movements,permafrost degredation,retrogressive thaw slumps,statistical modelling,thermokarst","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2024-05-29 02:05:41","2024-05-29 02:05:54","",""

This study combines organic matter geothermometry with fluid inclusion microthermometry, clumped isotope data (Δ47) for late ore-stage hydrothermal calcite, and apatite fission-track analyses to constrain the thermal evolution of Carlin-type gold zones in central Yukon. The Tmax parameter derived from pyrolysis analyses indicates that organic matter is overmature and records regional temperatures of > 150 °C. Calcite and fluorite associated with the waning stage of mineralization at ca. 74 Ma have mean fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures of 123–173 °C, with an average salinity of 4.8 wt.% NaCl equiv. These temperatures overlap values of 91–162 °C determined from calcite clumped isotope measurements and are similar to data from Carlin-type deposits in Nevada. Fluid mixing is suggested by a variation of the isotopic composition of the fluid in equilibrium with calcite, with the higher temperature end-member having higher δ18OH2O values. In thermal models based on Tmax, fluid inclusion microthermometry, clumped isotope measurements, and apatite fission-track data, a higher temperature event at approximately 220 °C is consistent with pyrobitumen reflectance measurements. This event is either related to maximum tectonic burial prior to mineralization or to the flow of acidic hydrothermal fluids early in the main ore-stage. Each analytical technique used in this study is independent of the others and records part of the thermal and chemical evolution of the Yukon Carlin-type gold deposits and their host rocks.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,apatite fission track,carlin-type deposits,clumped isotope thermometry,fluid inclusion,organic matter reflectance,yukon","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2024-05-29 04:05:05","2024-05-29 04:05:25","",""

The study area for this project is located in the vicinity of the Village of Haines Junction (Dakwäkäda) and lies between the Denali and Shakwak fault zones. The main aim of this project is to analyze and interpret a variety of pre-existing and newly acquired geological and geophysical datasets to evaluate where geothermal reservoirs may be present within the study area. A secondary aim is to propose favourable drilling locations, if warranted, for exploratory wells to collect information on subsurface temperature and permeability. The geoscience work accomplished here includes both 2D map interpretation as well as construction of a 3D geologic model that was guided by geophysical inversion modelling of gravity, magnetic and audio-magnetotelluric survey data. At a regional scale, multiple lines of evidence suggest that subsurface temperatures are above the crustal average. More importantly, a municipal water well drilled in 2002 in the Village of Haines Junction produce warm (~20 °C) water from a depth of ~350 m. This water well proves that at least one permeable sediment-hosted geothermal aquifer is present under Haines Junction. Additional geothermal aquifers within the pile of young sediment that sits atop the bedrock are likely present. However, due to a lack of deep drilling in the area, the exact location, temperature, thickness and permeability of such aquifers remains unknown. In this study, a depth-to-bedrock model has been generated to aid with the identification of favourable target areas for exploratory drilling of geothermal wells. The four areas where the top-of-bedrock is deepest have estimated depths in the range 650 to 1225 m below ground surface. Temperature data from two wells in the Haines Junction area suggests the temperature gradient is ~60 °C/km. Thus, geothermal aquifers located near the top-of-bedrock in the four areas identified could have temperatures in the range of 39–74 °C. Production of geothermal fluids from these areas requires permeability in the sediments that sit above the bedrock. Deeper drilling is needed to measure actual subsurface temperatures beneath the village and to identify permeable intervals. Geologic structures and faults that may control permeability in the bedrock remain poorly constrained.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Denali fault,dezadeash,geophysical inversion,geothermal,shakwak fault","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2024-07-15 03:07:37","2024-09-12 01:09:48","",""

These rocks are becoming increasingly recognized for their potential to act as atmospheric CO2 sinks. Carbon mineralization locks CO2 in carbonate minerals and stores it over geological time scales. This is a naturally occurring process but one that can be accelerated through increasing the available surface area of serpentinized material, or through injection of CO2-enriched fluids into serpentinized rock substrates. The Yukon has significant occurrences of ultramafic rock throughout the territory, covering a mapped areal extent of approximately 2000 km2. This work represents a preliminary attempt to review territorial opportunities for carbon mineralization via ultramafic rocks. Regional scale magnetic data which can help identify serpentinized parts of ultramafic bodies was used to remotely locate prospective ultramafic rocks in the Yukon, and to model targeted bodies in 3D to derive their volumes and estimate their CO2 mineralization capacities. Local volumes of serpentinized rock modelled within the depth interval of 0 to -4000 m range up to 361 km3, and total capacity estimated for all modelled sites in the Yukon from 0 to -4000 m depth is >1600 GtCO2. In order to meet emissions-offset targets required to mitigate climate change, such natural carbon sinks providing potentially large storage capacities must be considered part of the solution.

The effectiveness of SIP analysis was demonstrated using a FUCHS frequency domain instrument, which measured electrical impedance magnitude and phase shift angle at multiple frequencies (1.46 Hz–40 kHz). The main focus of the analysis centered on the results obtained from electrical impedance magnitude and phase shift angle inversion at 40 kHz and 1.46 Hz. The inversion results revealed the presence of high resistivity layers within the subsurface, similar to results that would be expected with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Additionally, the SIP data revealed that some areas with high resistivity also had negative phase shift angle values, suggesting the presence of materials with polarizing properties. The analysis of the imaginary part of electrical impedance at 40 kHz for these areas highlighted the contribution of polarization, indicating the presence of ice. Furthermore, the electrical impedance magnitude at
1.46 Hz exhibited similarities to the 40 kHz analysis, but with higher resistivity. This pattern is another indicator of the presence of ice within the subsurface of the study area and was expressed using the Resistivity Frequency Effect (RFE) equation. The RFE analysis and the patterns of polarization confirmed the presence of the pingo ice core and identified its distinctive signature compared to other layers. Subsequent drilling confirmed the presence of interbedded ice and clay from 2.4–3.6 m depth and massive ice from 3.6–8.3 m depth.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Haines Junction,Ice,Permafrost,pingo,yukon","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2024-12-11 03:12:54","2024-12-11 03:12:07","",""

96060,"information","Yukon hardrock mining, development and exploration overview 2024","The Yukon hardrock mineral exploration sector continued to thrive in 2024 with the release of exciting results and the announcement of seven new mineral resources. Although there were many successes in the Yukon’s exploration industry this past year, they were not immune to the negative impact of the heap leach pad failure that occurred on June 24, 2024, at Victoria Gold Corp.’s Eagle Gold Mine. At the time of writing, the Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) estimates exploration expenditures in the Yukon to be $145M for the year, based on company press releases, System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) postings, and conversations with industry clients. This estimate of the exploration expenditure is down 9% from $160M in 2023. Development expenditures for 2024 are estimated to be $40M, down from $84M in 2023. The decrease in exploration expenditures in 2024 compared with 2023 can be attributed to the heap leach pad failure at the Eagle Gold Mine, which impacted exploration programs across the Yukon. This led some companies to temporarily pause or completely halt their program for the remainder of the 2024 exploration season. The halt in exploration programs was, in part, a response to the demands voiced by some First Nations, such as the First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun, who called for an immediate halt to all mining and exploration activity in their Traditional Territory (First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun, 2024). The Government of Yukon responded stating that the territory cannot halt all existing, permitted mineral development activities, as mining and exploration companies are protected under the federal and territorial legislation and the Umbrella Final Agreement (Government of Yukon, 2024b).

Mineral production is estimated to be at least $190M (approximately 57.5% attributed to silver production and 42.5% attributed to gold production), down from $513M in 2023. Mineral production was low in 2024 due to the current closure of the Eagle Gold Mine, which was one of the two active hardrock mines in the Yukon. However, production revenue at Keno Hill Mine remains high due to precious metal prices reaching an all-time high and remaining strong in 2024.

As of November 30, 2024, there were 84 active exploration projects in the Yukon, which is comparable to the number of projects in 2022 and 2023; 29 of these were partially funded through the Yukon Mineral Exploration Program (YMEP). In 2017, the Yukon began to experience a decline in the number of active exploration projects along with fewer active companies and individual prospectors, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, those numbers have stabilized since 2022.

This seismic network has a complex history of adoption and integration of past temporary seismic experiments. We summarize this history along with the challenges in operating in the Canadian North. The WARNS stations provide continuous, weak-motion broadband seismic recordings. The data from these are made accessible (in real time for many stations) via integration within the EarthScope Data Management Centre. This enables open access and facilitates improvements in regional earthquake monitoring and geoscientific discovery. Northwestern Canada is geologically and tectonically complex, which leads to elevated geohazard potential. The environment in the Canadian north is also rapidly evolving in response to climate change, which has the potential to enhance hazards. Studies that rely on data from WARNS play an important role in developing adaptation strategies for the evolving needs and hazards in Canada’s north.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2025-01-18 03:01:15","2025-01-23 10:01:58","",""

However, there are few detailed studies on Tonian reef development to constrain this ecologically significant transformation. Here, we build on previous documentation of reefal buildups in the ca. 850780 Ma Fifteenmile Group in the Coal Creek inlier (Ogilvie Mountains) and contribute seven new detailed stratigraphic sections featuring microbial accumulations in the Reefal assemblage. We document the stratigraphic context for these Tonian reefs and distinguish between predominantly laminated and unlaminated microbial textures. In addition, we identify rare instances of exceptional preservation of unlaminated microbialite, suggesting that reef-building microbialites of the Reefal assemblage have similar framework morphologies to those of the approximately coeval Little Dal Group in the Mackenzie Mountains.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2025-01-18 03:01:03","2025-01-23 10:01:02","",""

Here, the well-preserved Klaza Au–Ag–Pb–Zn porphyry–epithermal deposit is used as a type-example of Late Cretaceous magmatic–hydrothermal mineralization to address the complex metallogeny of the DRGB. U–Pb zircon dating defines four magmatic pulses of Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous ages with the latter consisting of the Casino (80–72 Ma) and Prospector Mt. (72–65 Ma) suites. The Casino suite has five phases of intermediate-to-felsic calc-alkaline composition, correspond with older (77 Ma) porphyry mineralization, and displays evidence of magma mingling. The intermediate-to-mafic, slightly alkalic Prospector Mt. suite shows evidence of mingling with the youngest Casino suite phases, correlates with younger (71 Ma), intermediate-sulfidation epithermal and porphyry-type mineralization, and shoshonitic basalts of the Carmacks Group. Zircon trace element data suggest a common melt source for these suites; however, the younger suite records features (e.g., high La/Yb) that indicate a higher pressure melt source. The results from this study highlight the Prospector Mt. suite as a historically overlooked causative magma event linked to Au-rich PCDs in the DRGB and extends the temporal window of PCD prospectivity in this area. The transition from mid-Cretaceous Whitehorse suite magmas to Late Cretaceous Casino-Prospector Mt. suite magmas is proposed to reflect a transition from subduction to localized extension, which is becoming more recognized as a common characteristic of productive porphyry belts globally.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Casino,Dawson Range,Klaza,Prospector Mt.,metallogeny,paragenesis,petrogenesis,post-subduction,slab rollback,telescoped porphyry,yukon","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2025-04-03 08:04:54","2025-04-03 08:04:16","",""

Though widely documented, the timing and magnitude of displacement on many of these orogen-parallel faults are not well-constrained. Here, we present new low-temperature thermochronology data and thermal history models from the Upper Hyland River Valley area in the Logan Mountains in southeastern Yukon that document accelerated cooling between ca. 60–50 Ma in localized regions adjacent to faults that strike obliquely to and likely connect with the Logan fault. We propose that this phase of localized cooling was driven by the activation of a network of faults in the Upper Hyland River Valley, resulting in ∼4–5.5 km of local exhumation. We suggest that faulting in the Upper Hyland River Valley was synthetic with dextral slip on the Tintina fault, a lithospheric-scale structure thought to have accommodated ∼430 km of dextral strike-slip.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Canadian Cordillera,Upper Hyland,apatite,faults,thermochronology,yukon","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2025-04-03 09:04:43","2025-04-03 09:04:19","",""

Earthquake source studies in Yukon and northern British Columbia have been limited by sparse seismic network coverage. In this work, we leverage recent seismic network improvements to estimate focal mechanisms for small- and moderate-magnitude (M > 2.0) earthquakes from P-wave first-motion polarity data. We invert these data within a probabilistic framework to rigorously quantify mechanism uncertainties. Subsequently, probabilistic earthquake focal mechanisms are used as input for inversions for the orientation of principal stress axes, and stress shape ratio, for spatial windows throughout the region. We implement a novel, data-driven approach to propagate focal mechanism uncertainty in stress inversion. Our results improve the spatial coverage of existing earthquake focal mechanisms and enable an orogenic-scale study of crustal stress near the Yakutat–North America collision. Overall, the region is characterized by a transpressive stress regime. Maximum horizontal compressive stress orientations exhibit a pattern orthogonal to the Yakutat collision syntaxis. Stress inversion results also reveal an abrupt change in orientation east-to-west, which we interpret as a change in stress regime across the Fairweather–Connector–Totschunda fault system that is likely related to coupling between the subducting Yakutat slab and North America. This work improves our understanding of potential earthquake hazards in southwestern Yukon and the surrounding region.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Yakutat,earthquake,focal,yukon","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2025-04-03 04:04:53","2025-04-03 04:04:41","",""
96114,"information","Preliminary observations from four reduced intrusion-related gold deposits, Selwyn basin, Yukon","Host rocks, veins and alteration in reduced intrusion-related gold (RIRG) deposits display similar features and distribution across the Tombstone gold belt (TGB). The primary intrusive rocks hosting gold at these deposits are felsic to intermediate, silica-saturated, alkalic to calcic, metaluminous to weakly peraluminous magnesian (calc-alkaline) granodiorite, quartz-monzonite, monzonite and syenite. Preliminary field and petrographic observations suggest that distribution of veins, vein textures, and their correlative vein selvedge alteration assemblages show similar distribution patterns to porphyry deposit models on a more spatially restricted but observable (drill core) scale. At each of the deposits examined on four properties, sulphide-poor (3–5% sulphide minerals) quartz veins were commonly observed proximal to the causative intrusion, whereas sulphide-rich (>10% sulphide minerals) veins tend to be more distal, though are commonly observed using the same fluid pathways as earlier veins. Early sulphide-poor quartz veins commonly exhibit potassic and locally sodic alteration in vein selvedges, whereas sulphide-rich veins typically coincide with phyllic (sericitic) alteration. Sinuous veins with diffuse boundaries suggest emplacement within a higher temperature ductile regime closer to the centre of the mineralizing intrusion, whereas sharp, straight-sided quartz sulphide-rich veins are more typical and emplaced within a moderate temperature brittle regime in the intrusion carapace and hornfelsed country rocks.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,Brewery Creek,RC Gold,RIRGS,Selwyn Basin,Steiner,Tombstone Gold Belt,Valley,deposit,gold,intrusion related gold,reduced intrusion related gold,yukon","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2025-04-17 10:04:18","2025-04-22 09:04:18","",""

The Dawson fault is a prominent east‐weststriking structure in central Yukon that is interpreted herein to have been active as a rift‐transfer fault by late Cambrian time. This hypothesis is supported by new zircon U‐Pb dates that range from 501.98 ± 0.17 Ma to 497.57 ± 0.70 Ma from alkaline mafic volcanic rocks concentrated along the Dawson fault. The development of a sub‐Jiangshanian unconformity immediately post‐dates this alkaline magmatism and indicates that final continental breakup and establishment of the northern Cordilleran margin occurred by the late Miaolinginan. Alkaline magmatism caused by local decompression partial melting of the mantle may have been triggered by the release of in‐plane tensile stresses during lithospheric rupture and edge‐driven mantle convection. Upper Ordovician alkaline mafic volcanic and plutonic rocks that occur along a northwest‐southeast striking segment of the Dawson fault erupted ∼50 Myr after breakup and represent an example of post‐rift magmatism along a rift‐transfer fault. New bedrock mapping, and geochronological, paleontological, and petrological results from Upper Ordovician rocks indicate that there was localized basin development and punctuated volcanism along the Dawson fault from 453 to 447 Ma. Late Ordovician extension and post‐breakup magmatism in central Yukon is compatible with dextral strike‐slip reactivation of the Dawson rift‐transfer fault associated with counterclockwise rotation of Laurentia.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2025-05-16 10:05:29","2025-05-16 01:05:04","",""

The deposit has been interpreted as having characteristics of numerous deposit types over the project’s history including epithermal, reduced intrusion-related, Carlin-type, and orogenic gold, as well as combinations of deposit types. Recent mapping efforts and new geochronology highlight a previously unknown secondary phase of the Permian Sulphur Creek suite and led to the relocation of the Coffee Creek fault which is interpreted as a primary controlling structure of the Coffee deposit. A new structural analysis builds on previous depth estimates and suggests that the deposit formed at a relatively shallow depth of 1–3 km and together with the new map has outlined the structural history of the deposit in greater detail. New dike geochemistry suggests some mineralized Coffee dikes may be related to the Carmacks group volcanics or Prospector Mountain suite intrusives, which implies a Late Cretaceous age of formation. Field relationships and timing of regional faulting together corroborate a minimum age of formation of ~57 Ma. Available multi-element geochemistry highlights a subtle Au-As-Sb ± Ag-Pb-Te-W-Zn-K metal association that suggests a possible magmatic component to the mineralizing fluids at Coffee.

The “Klondike orogeny” was thought to be associated with mid‐crustal deformation and metamorphism and development of a thick orogenic welt in the late Permian (ca. 260–252 Ma; Lopingian). A review of lithogeochemical data combined with new U‐Pb geochronology and Hf isotope data of igneous and detrital zircons from the western Yukon‐Tanana terrane supports development of a mid to late Permian (ca. 265–255 Ma; Guadalupian‐Lopingian) arc in a supra‐subduction zone setting. Arc development was preceded by hyper‐extension and emplacement of supra‐subduction zone ophiolites (ca. 268–264 Ma). Precise CA‐TIMS U‐Pb dating of zircon in plutons inferred to constrain the timing of the “Klondike orogeny” show that they are the same age (ca. 260.9 Ma) and that previous dates are too young due to unmitigated Pb loss. A critical review of evidence for regional metamorphism indicates that mid‐crustal deformation and metamorphism is related to accretion of the Intermontane terranes in the Early Jurassic. Mica cooling ages show that the western Yukon‐Tanana terrane was exhumed to upper crustal level in the Jurassic. Sinistral transpression facilitated development of the Yukon‐Tanana terrane and subsequent tectonic activity from mid‐Paleozoic to early Mesozoic and probably linked the Permian closure of the Slide Mountain Ocean with intermittent late Paleozoic deformation culminating in the Sonoma orogeny of the U.S. Cordillera.","Science and technology","Yukon Geological Survey,cordillera,klondike,orogeny,yukon-tanana","Yukon Geological Survey","geology@yukon.ca","Yukon Geological Survey","","","OGL-Yukon-2.0","","","2025-06-16 12:06:58","2025-06-16 01:06:12","",""
