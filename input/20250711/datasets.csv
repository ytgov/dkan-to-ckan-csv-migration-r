347,public,Environment Yukon - Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,,"<div style=""text-align:Left;""> Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest.

341,public,Environment Yukon - Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,,"<div style=""text-align:Left;""> Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically.

107,public,Yukon Geological Survey â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,,"  Regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation<br><br>  November 2020<br><br>  Release notes<br><br>  The regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation comprises data for more than 30 000 samples across Yukon. This compilation updates the work of H&eacute;on (2003). This new compilation includes results from the reanalysis of more than 24 000 samples; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis provides upgraded detection limits and a broader range of elements relative to previous analytical data. In addition to analytical data, efforts have been made to improve sample location accuracy. The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:<br><br><ol><li>  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in H&eacute;on (2003) with minor updates to sample location.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).<br><br></li><li>  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li></ol>  Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below. <br><br>  For atomic absorption spectrometry  (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using   Lefort aqua regia or   concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.<br><br>  For instrumental neutron activation analysis (  INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.<br><br>  For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment (  the minus 0.177 mm fraction)   ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.<br><br>  Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey.

It includes new, detailed bedrock geology maps and regional compilations that have been published by the Yukon Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada between 1999 and 2015, as well as some recent thesis works. A few of these maps were partially integrated into the digital dataset by Gordey and Makepeace (2003), but only as overlay to the 1999 compilation. A number of errors and omissions from the 1999 compilation of Gordey and Makepeace were also noted and corrected during compilation of this version of the map. The Yukon bedrock geology GIS dataset is regularly updated and can be downloaded from the Yukon Geological Survey's website: www.geology.gov.yk.ca. Users are advised to consult the website regularly to ensure they are working with the latest version of the geodatabase or shape files. This update of the GIS dataset includes an expanded attribute structure (compared to the 1999 dataset) that facilitates searching of the geodatabase.

33,public,Geomatics Yukon â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," The Waterbodies dataset is comprised of area features: lakes, intermittent waterbodies, islands, and rivers wide enough to be represented as an area feature (e.g. St. Lawrence River, Mackenzie River). In a few exceptional cases, islands had to be represented by ""holes"" in the polygons in the Waterbodies dataset. Some area features have been subdivided and several types of virtual linear features serve to separate them. Features in this dataset are linked (by an attribute) to their corresponding flow line in the Drainage Network Skeleton. Therefore the Waterbodies dataset may be used in conjunction with the Drainage Network Skeleton for analytical applications. The Islands dataset is comprised of area and linear features: islands within inland waters and the waterbodies and single line rivers within these islands. Oceanic islands are not included as they are part of the coastline component of the Drainage Network Skeleton dataset. The Islands dataset exists to complete the cartographic representation of Canadian hydrology. The Islands dataset is not logically connected with the Drainage Network Skeleton, and can not be used for analytical applications. It should be noted that flow lines of the Drainage Network Skeleton do not take into account of the existence of islands and therefore do not necessarily flow around them. In a few exceptional cases, islands had to be represented by ""holes"" in the polygons in the Waterbodies dataset. Some islands themselves contain waterbodies and rivers, not significant for network analysis. However, in order to support a complete cartographic representation such waterbodies and rivers have been added to the Islands dataset. The National Scale Frameworks Hydrology data consists of area, linear and point geospatial and attribute data for Canada's hydrology at a national scale. It provides a representation of Canada's surface water features, and data completeness reflects the content of the source, the original Vector Map level 0 (VMAP0) revision 4 hydrographic layers, except where revision editing has been performed. Key value-added characteristics include river flow direction, connectivity and the tagging of geographical name keys to selected rivers, lakes and islands included in the Concise Gazetteer of Canada.  <br><br> The Atlas Frameworks are a set of integrated base map layers which form part of a larger National Scale Frameworks data collection.

WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment.

Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically.

311,public,Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,,"  Background:<br><br>  More than 80% of the heat produced in the Earth's crust comes from granitoid rocks. When granitoid rocks form they naturally concentrate radioactive elements such as U, Th, and K, and the radiogenic decay of these elements is an exothermic reaction. The radioactive decay of these elements within a granitoid body may generate local heat anomalies and elevated geothermal gradient at relatively shallow crustal levels. In combination with other local rock properties (e.g, porosity, permeability, thermal conductivity), radiogenic heat has the potential to generate a geothermal resource. The decay of radioactive elements converts mass into radiation energy, which in turn gets converted to heat. While all naturally radioactive isotopes generate some heat, significant heat generation only occurs from the decay of 238 U ,235 U ,232 Th and 40 K. Therefore, potential heat production is governed by the concentrations of U ,Th and K in the rock. In igneous rocks, radiogenic heat production is dependent on the bulk chemistry of the rock and decreases from acidic (e.g. granite) through basic to ultra basic rock types. Therefore, granites with anomalously high concentrations of U ,Th and K are targets for calculating potential radiogenic heat production. Potential radiogenic heat production (A)from plutonic rocks can be calculated using this equation: <br><br>  A (\u03BCW/m  3   )=10  -5   \u1D29 (9.52c  u  +2.56c  K  +3.48c  Th  )<br><br>  where ""c"" is the concentration of radioactive elements ""U"" and ""Th"" in ppm, and ""K"" in %; and ""\u1D29"" is the rock density. Heat production constants of the natural radio-elements U, Th, K are 9.525x10  -5  , 2.561x10  -5   and 3.477x10  -9   W/kg, respectively. <br><br>  Data and Methods:<br><br>  Geochemical data from ~1760 samples of plutonic rocks from Yukon are used to calculate potential heat production. The calculated values for radiogenic heat production (A) are plotted over the mapped distribution of Paleozoic and younger plutonic rocks and major crustal faults are also shown for reference.<br><br><br><br>",As Needed,,https://yukon.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3974e3b8410f4906801bb31710537d57,,ogly,2024-02-13T01:02:28.000Z,Geomatics Yukon,https://yukon.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/3974e3b8410f4906801bb31710537d57/info/metadata/metadata.xml,,"-141.3251,59.7186,-123.3130,68.7817",Yukon,"geothermal,earth science,geology,Yukon,Yukon Territory,Canada,GeoYukon,GeoYukon",,,Geothermal Radiogenic Heat Production,"Nature and environment,Science and Technology"

WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest.

105,public,Yukon Geological Survey â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,,"  Regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation<br><br>  November 2020<br><br>  Release notes<br><br>  The regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation comprises data for more than 30 000 samples across Yukon. This compilation updates the work of H&eacute;on (2003). This new compilation includes results from the reanalysis of more than 24 000 samples; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis provides upgraded detection limits and a broader range of elements relative to previous analytical data. In addition to analytical data, efforts have been made to improve sample location accuracy. The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:<br><br><ol><li>  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in H&eacute;on (2003) with minor updates to sample location.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).<br><br></li><li>  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li></ol>  Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below. <br><br>  For atomic absorption spectrometry  (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using   Lefort aqua regia or   concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.<br><br>  For instrumental neutron activation analysis (  INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.<br><br>  For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment (  the minus 0.177 mm fraction)   ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.<br><br>  Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey.

104,public,Yukon Geological Survey â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,,"  Regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation<br><br>  November 2020<br><br>  Release notes<br><br>  The regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation comprises data for more than 30 000 samples across Yukon. This compilation updates the work of H&eacute;on (2003). This new compilation includes results from the reanalysis of more than 24 000 samples; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis provides upgraded detection limits and a broader range of elements relative to previous analytical data. In addition to analytical data, efforts have been made to improve sample location accuracy. The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:<br><br><ol><li>  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in H&eacute;on (2003) with minor updates to sample location.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).<br><br></li><li>  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li></ol>  Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below. <br><br>  For atomic absorption spectrometry  (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using   Lefort aqua regia or   concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.<br><br>  For instrumental neutron activation analysis (  INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.<br><br>  For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment (  the minus 0.177 mm fraction)   ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.<br><br>  Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey.

225,public,Department of Environment â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," Ecoregions of Yukon, 2014 is an update to the Yukon portion of the 1995 National Ecological Framework (NEF) described in Ecoregions of Yukon (Smith et al 2004). Because of people's familiarity with the 1995 NEF, and its use in management and planning, these ecoregion revisions attempted to retain the 1995 divisions unless there were compelling reasons to change them. In Yukon there were several compelling reasons to revise the 1995 NEF: 1) capitalize on availability of digital inventory and knowledge and improve or adjust the 1995 mapping as necessary, 2) harmonize stratification along jurisdictional borders, 3) incorporate line work updates to the Soil Landscape polygons by Agriculture and AgriFood Canada (AAFC) happening concurrently, and 4) include Yukon revisions in a national update of NEF ecozones across Canada - led by Environment Canada (CCEA 2017). <br><br> Mapping the ecoregions of Yukon is largely a top-down process and the divisional hierarchy is nested. The lowest level of the hierarchy is the Soil Landscapes of Canada unit (Soil Landscape Component, or SLC). SLCs are organized according to a uniform set of national soil and landscape criteria that are based on permanent natural attributes. SLCs polygons are not published in this release. Ecozones, ecoregions and ecodistricts are subdivisions at the continental scale of climatic zones; attention to physiography increases as map scale increases. There are many reasonable ways to distinguish Yukon ecoregions. Ecoregions are delineated principally on abiotic features, such as bedrock geology, glacial history and physiography, and so are relatively stable (i.e. enduring) over time. While considering changes to the 1995 NEF, the project team continued to recognize major physiographic and climatic distinctions. At the ecozone level the team included a stronger regional climate element and related the ecozone level to the bioclimate framework. <br><br> The Ecoregions of Yukon concept is used for broad scale management applications. Its structure helps define ecologically relevant management units at various scales. The Ecoregions of the Yukon Territory (Smith et al. 2004) describes Yukon's ecozones and ecoregions represented in the 1995 NEF (ESWG 1995). This reference continues to be a useful and relevant resource the Ecoregions of Yukon, 2014. For a fulsome treatment of the updates in the Ecoregions of Yukon, 2014 please refer to the report ""Ecoregions of Yukon: Revisions to the Yukon portion of the National Ecological Framework.""

170,public,Client Monitoring & Inspections â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," The Fish Habitat Management System for Yukon Placer Mining replaced the Yukon Place Authorization (YPA) in 15 Yukon watersheds on April 11, 2008. Founded on principles of adaptive management and incorporating a risk-based approach to decision-making, the system is intended to balance the objectives of a sustainable Yukon placer mining industry with the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat supporting fisheries Adaptive management recognizes that the effectiveness of any management system is hampered by a degree of uncertainty and lack of knowledge. It seeks to improve the system by monitoring the effects of management actions, in order to learn from the results. The Adaptive Management Framework for Yukon placer mining is complemented by traditional knowledge and water quality objectives monitoring, aquatic health monitoring and economic health monitoring programs. The results should provide new information and a rational basis for making any adjustments required to achieve the two management objectives. The water quality objectives monitoring program is governed by the Water Quality Objectives Monitoring Protocol. The Protocol describes the locations, timing, frequency and methods employed during sampling, as well as the methods used to analyze sampling data. Precipitation data was collected from a variety of sources to assist in the interpretation of results. The water quality objectives monitoring program relies upon both continuous sampling and grab sampling. Continuous sampling is performed by automated instruments that pump water from the creek or river at a preset volume and at precise times each day. Grab samples are taken by personnel at a selected location, depth and time. Normally the quantity of water taken is sufficient for all the physical and chemical analyses that will be done on the sample. Grab sampling is also performed during sampling ""blitzes"", when single grab samples are collected from as many sites as possible within a short timeframe in order to get a snapshot of the water quality in a watershed over a 24 hour period.<br><br>  Distributed from <a href='https://yukon.ca/geoyukon' rel='nofollow ugc'>  GeoYukon</a>   by the <a href='https://yukon.ca/maps' rel='nofollow ugc'>  Government of Yukon</a>  .

34,public,Geomatics Yukon â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," Atlas of Canada National Frameworks data are standardized national coverages of commonly used geospatial datasets at the 1:1 000 000 scale. The Drainage Network Skeleton dataset is comprised of linear features: single line rivers, flow lines within waterbodies and ocean coastlines. Flow lines within waterbodies are virtual linear features representing the hydrological flow through area features (e.g. lakes, rivers and intermittent waterbodies). These flow lines complete the linear network where rivers would run through lakes, permitting hydrologic network analysis and cartographic generalization. This dataset is required for analytical applications. The coastline component of the Drainage Network Skeleton also delineates oceanic islands. The National Scale Frameworks Hydrology data consists of area, linear and point geospatial and attribute data for Canada's hydrology at a national scale. It provides a representation of Canada's surface water features, and data completeness reflects the content of the source, the original Vector Map level 0 (VMAP0) revision 4 hydrographic layers, except where revision editing has been performed. Key value-added characteristics include river flow direction, connectivity and the tagging of geographical name keys to selected rivers, lakes and islands included in the Concise Gazetteer of Canada.<br><br> The Atlas Frameworks are a set of integrated base map layers which form part of a larger National Scale Frameworks data collection. These data have been compiled at a scale of 1:1 000 000 with the primary goal being to indicate correct relative positioning with other framework layers rather than absolute positional accuracy.<br><br>  Distributed from <a href='https://yukon.ca/geoyukon' rel='nofollow ugc' style='text-decoration:underline;'>  GeoYukon</a>   by the <a href='https://yukon.ca/maps' rel='nofollow ugc' style='text-decoration:underline;'>  Government of Yukon</a>  .

The methodology used, map accuracy, and credits vary by project; these project details are outlined in Table 5 (see below). The spatial extent of individual projects are delineated in a separate feature class entitled, &quot;WETLAND_BROAD_EXTENTS_POLY&quot;. The &quot;Project Name&quot; attribute field, common to both feature classes, denotes the specific project each feature is associated with. <br><br> <br /><br><br> This dataset is intended to be used as a broad scale planning and management tool to identify potential distribution and abundance of wetlands. Wetlands were mapped to wetland class (shallow water, marsh, swamp, fen, and bog), following the Canadian Wetland Classification System using a predictive model. This dataset is intended to support land management and regional land use planning processes.  Local scale (10k) manual wetland mapping, and additional physical assessments (i.e. ground inspections) may be required to undertake habitat enhancement, environmental assessment, reclamation planning, or environmental mitigation over small to moderate areas.<br><br> <br><br><span style='font-weight:bold;'><br /><br><br><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Map development:<br><br> The &quot;Wetlands - Broad Scale&quot; dataset was developed using a random forest machine learning model to predict wetland classes. Various satellite imagery sources and landscape variables derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used as primary inputs to predict wetlands. The source dataset has a resolution of 10 x 10 m. Training and validation data are a mix of ground plots (site visit and ecosystem plots), aerial survey plots, and interpreted polygons. Each predictive wetland map within the composite has met the minimum criteria of a map accuracy greater than or equal to 70 % and a Kappa coefficient greater than 0.60.  <br><br> <br /><br><br> The map (or producer's) accuracy measures the percentage of wetland features that are correctly classified to one of the five wetland classes. <br><br> <br /><br><br> The Kappa coefficient statistic is used to measure the extent to which the model has correctly predicted, given the set of validation data. A value of 0 indicates predicted values are entirely random. A value of 1 indicates a perfect model. As a general rule, Kappa coefficients less than 0.60 indicate a poorly performing model, values of 0.61 to 0.80 indicate substantial agreement between predicted and validation data, and values of 0.81 to 1.00 indicate almost perfect agreement.<br><br> <br /><br><br> The size of the smallest wetland that can be reliably mapped, the Target Mapping Unit (TMU), was not established for this dataset at the time of publication.

WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife.

It includes new, detailed bedrock geology maps and regional compilations that have been published by the Yukon Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada between 1999 and 2015, as well as some recent thesis works. A few of these maps were partially integrated into the digital dataset by Gordey and Makepeace (2003), but only as overlay to the 1999 compilation. A number of errors and omissions from the 1999 compilation of Gordey and Makepeace were also noted and corrected during compilation of this version of the map. The Yukon bedrock geology GIS dataset is regularly updated and can be downloaded from the Yukon Geological Survey's website: www.geology.gov.yk.ca. Users are advised to consult the website regularly to ensure they are working with the latest version of the geodatabase or shape files. This update of the GIS dataset includes an expanded attribute structure (compared to the 1999 dataset) that facilitates searching of the geodatabase.

168,public,Geomatics Yukon â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," The Adaptive Management Framework for Yukon placer mining is complemented by traditional   knowledge and monitoring of water quality objectives, aquatic health, and economic health.  The aquatic health monitoring program is governed by the Aquatic Health Monitoring Protocol.  The Protocol describes the locations, timing, frequency and methods employed during   sampling, as well as the methods used to analyze sampling data. The Reference Condition Approach (RCA) is the method chosen for assessing the health of freshwater ecosystems in the Yukon. One RCA model was developed for bioassessment based upon benthic   macroinvertebrates, and a second model was developed to assess the diversity of fish species.  The RCA model for invertebrates relies upon 224 reference sites collected over the period   2004 to 2010 by the University of Western Ontario, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and  Yukon G overnment, using the same standard protocol. The invertebrate data set was analyzed   at the family level.  There are two fundamental steps in the process of developing the predictive model. The first is to classify the reference sites based on their biological characteristics. This requires defining a   number of community types based on the taxonomic composition. The second step is to   determine a subset of habitat attributes that are associated with those community types.   Following this step the number and type of organisms expected to occur at any given site can be determined from habitat attributes.

322,public,Yukon Geological Survey â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," Yukon Territory has been glaciated by Cordilleran and montane glaciers at various times throughout the Pleistocene, as well as by continental ice, the Laurentine Ice Sheet in the Late Pleistocene. Throughout the Late Cenozoic, each successive glaciation appears to have been less extensive than the previous one. In west-central Yukon the earliest glaciation occurred between 2.6 and 2.9 Ma. ago (Duk-Rodkin and Barendregt, 1997). This glaciation was the most extensive and formed a continuous carapace of ice covering all the mountain ranges, except for a small area of Dawson Range and a more extensive area in northern Yukon. The Mid Pleistocene Cordilleran glaciation was less extensive than older glaciations but it formed an extensive ice sheet covering most of the northern Cordillera. The Late Pleistocene glaciation was the most restrictive and formed a continuous carapace of ice from the continental divide to the Saint Elias Mountains, but only restricted ice caps formed on the Ogilvie Mountains. During the last glaciation, the Laurentide Ice Sheet, flowing from the east, reached the northeast part of the Yukon Territory ca. 30 ka ago.<br><br>  Distributed from <a href='https://yukon.ca/geoyukon' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'>  GeoYukon</a>   by the <a href='https://yukon.ca/maps' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'>  Government of Yukon</a>  .

317,public,Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," Curie point depth (CPD) mapping in Yukon was done using public domain aeromagnetic data from Natural Resources Canada. In this study, two different CPD methodologies were employed using two different window sizes (200 km and 300 km). Qualitatively, the results were broadly consistent regardless of the method or window size. South-central Yukon exhibits shallow CPD values while northern and southeastern Yukon have deeper CPD values. This suggests that south-central Yukon has higher levels of heat flow in the mid-to-lower crust compared to the rest of the territory. The CPD results are largely consistent with heat flow measurements from the near surface. Specifically, regions with shallow CPD estimates correspond to areas with elevated heat flow measurements. Geologically, the regions with shallow CPD correspond to the Cordillera, while deep CPD areas appear to be co-located with continental platform rocks of Ancestral North America. Comparison with Yukon-specific crustal geotherms derived from other data suggest that the CPD estimates for south-central Yukon are systematically too deep by 2 to 12 km. The discrepancy is likely caused by the need to better understand and account for the fractal distribution of magnetization in the crust in Yukon. The results of this CPD study are valuable in that 95% of Yukon has been demarcated into regions of shallow CPD (higher heat flow) and deep CPD (lower heat flow). These findings should be combined with other data, such as heat generation and sediment thickness estimates, to identify the most prospective regions of elevated subsurface heat in Yukon.   Contours have been created for the gridded curie point depth at 1 km intervals and are presented along with the grid. <br><br> Distributed from <a href='https://mapservices.gov.yk.ca:443/GeoYukon/' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'> GeoYukon</a>  by the <a href='http://yukon.ca:80/' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'> Government of Yukon</a> .

The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:<br><br><ol><li>  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in H&eacute;on (2003) with minor updates to sample location.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).<br><br></li><li>  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li></ol>  Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below. <br><br>  For atomic absorption spectrometry  (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using   Lefort aqua regia or   concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.<br><br>  For instrumental neutron activation analysis (  INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.<br><br>  For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment (  the minus 0.177 mm fraction)   ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.<br><br>  Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey.

The landscape hazard map identifies existing and potential geological hazards such as landslides, permafrost stability and flooding. The hazard map is presented in stoplight colours to provide an intuitive tool for community decision makers aiming to incorporate an adaptation planning framework into existing land use management practices.

different scales. Additionally, there is a surficial geology map index.<br><br>

The polygon
attributes captured include surficial material, texture, age, surface
expression, and geomorphological processes. <br><br>

Line features
include geological contacts, glacial limits, glacial landforms (cirques,

106,public,Yukon Geological Survey â€“ Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,,"  Regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation<br><br>  November 2020<br><br>  Release notes<br><br>  The regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation comprises data for more than 30 000 samples across Yukon. This compilation updates the work of H&eacute;on (2003). This new compilation includes results from the reanalysis of more than 24 000 samples; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis provides upgraded detection limits and a broader range of elements relative to previous analytical data. In addition to analytical data, efforts have been made to improve sample location accuracy. The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:<br><br><ol><li>  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in H&eacute;on (2003) with minor updates to sample location.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.<br><br></li><li>  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).<br><br></li><li>  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.<br><br></li></ol>  Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below. <br><br>  For atomic absorption spectrometry  (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using   Lefort aqua regia or   concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.<br><br>  For instrumental neutron activation analysis (  INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.<br><br>  For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment (  the minus 0.177 mm fraction)   ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.<br><br>  Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey.

316,public,Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," Curie point depth (CPD) mapping in Yukon was done using public domain aeromagnetic data from Natural Resources Canada. In this study, two different CPD methodologies were employed using two different window sizes (200 km and 300 km). Qualitatively, the results were broadly consistent regardless of the method or window size. South-central Yukon exhibits shallow CPD values while northern and southeastern Yukon have deeper CPD values. This suggests that south-central Yukon has higher levels of heat flow in the mid-to-lower crust compared to the rest of the territory. The CPD results are largely consistent with heat flow measurements from the near surface. Specifically, regions with shallow CPD estimates correspond to areas with elevated heat flow measurements. Geologically, the regions with shallow CPD correspond to the Cordillera, while deep CPD areas appear to be co-located with continental platform rocks of Ancestral North America. Comparison with Yukon-specific crustal geotherms derived from other data suggest that the CPD estimates for south-central Yukon are systematically too deep by 2 to 12 km. The discrepancy is likely caused by the need to better understand and account for the fractal distribution of magnetization in the crust in Yukon. The results of this CPD study are valuable in that 95% of Yukon has been demarcated into regions of shallow CPD (higher heat flow) and deep CPD (lower heat flow). These findings should be combined with other data, such as heat generation and sediment thickness estimates, to identify the most prospective regions of elevated subsurface heat in Yukon.   Contours have been created for the gridded curie point depth at 1 km intervals and are presented along with the grid. <br><br> Distributed from <a href='https://mapservices.gov.yk.ca:443/GeoYukon/' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'> GeoYukon</a>  by the <a href='http://yukon.ca:80/' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'> Government of Yukon</a> .

Ground temperature investigations generally include the installation of temperature sensors at a variety of depth intervals, and data loggers which record the temperatures at regular time intervals (  e.g.,  hourly or daily) for varying time periods ranging from one-time or occasional measurements to multi-year monitoring. They also often involve the installation or monitoring of above-ground weather stations.

Potential landscape hazards were assessed under changing future conditions by incorporating a variety of data sets, including surficial geology, topography (slope and aspect), permafrost distribution, site-specific permafrost data (e.g. ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography and borehole data), analyses of past hydrological and climatological trends, and future climate projections. The landscape hazard map identifies existing and potential geological hazards such as landslides, permafrost stability and flooding. The hazard map is presented in stoplight colours to provide an intuitive tool for community decision makers aiming to incorporate an adaptation planning framework into existing land use management practices.

Because trapping is done primarily along waterways, RTCs are often defined by watersheds, using height of land (ridges and mountain peaks) as their boundaries. This is the opposite of GMAs which are defined by mountains. Sometimes RTCs are grouped together to form a Group Trapping Concession (in which groups of individual share the right to trap). This may or may not involve the elimination of the component RTC boundaries. The Yukon has 360 RTCs and 13 Group Trapping Concessions.

Wetlands were mapped to wetland class (shallow water, marsh, swamp, fen, and bog), following the Canadian Wetland Classification System using a predictive model. This dataset is intended to support land management and regional land use planning processes.  Local scale (10k) manual wetland mapping, and additional physical assessments (i.e. ground inspections) may be required to undertake habitat enhancement, environmental assessment, reclamation planning, or environmental mitigation over small to moderate areas.<br><br> <br><br><span style='font-weight:bold;'><br /><br><br><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Map development and attributes:<br><br> The &quot;Wetlands - Broad Scale&quot; dataset was developed using a random forest machine learning model to predict wetland classes. Various satellite imagery sources and landscape variables derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used as primary inputs to predict wetlands. The source dataset has a resolution of 10 x 10 m. Training and validation data are a mix of ground plots (site visit and ecosystem plots), aerial survey plots, and interpreted polygons. Each predictive wetland map within the composite has met the minimum criteria of a map accuracy greater than or equal to 70 % and a Kappa coefficient greater than 0.60.  <br><br> <br /><br><br> The map (or producer's) accuracy measures the percentage of wetland features that are correctly classified to one of the five wetland classes. <br><br> <br /><br><br> The Kappa coefficient statistic is used to measure the extent to which the model has correctly predicted, given the set of validation data. A value of 0 indicates predicted values are entirely random. A value of 1 indicates a perfect model. As a general rule, Kappa coefficients less than 0.60 indicate a poorly performing model, values of 0.61 to 0.80 indicate substantial agreement between predicted and validation data, and values of 0.81 to 1.00 indicate almost perfect agreement.<br><br> <br /><br><br> The size of the smallest wetland that can be reliably mapped, the Target Mapping Unit (TMU), was not established for this dataset at the time of publication. Wetland classes smaller than a TMU of 2.0 hectares in this dataset should be used with caution. Wetlands below the TMU have a higher potential to be associated with classification error. The reported map accuracy is adequate for the intended purpose, and assumes that training data has adequately captured variation in landscape and vegetation structure between and within wetland classes. <br><br> <br><br><span style='font-weight:bold;'><br /><br><br><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Table 1: Unique project details for each mapping area within the &quot;Wetlands - Broad Scale&quot; dataset.<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><p style='font-weight:bold; margin:0 0 0 0;'> Project Name<br><br></td><td><p style='font-weight:bold; margin:0 0 0 0;'>  Information<br><br></td><td><p style='font-weight:bold; margin:0 0 0 0;'>  Description<br><br></td></tr><tr><td rowspan='5'>  Beaver River<br><br></td><td>  Last Update<br><br></td><td>  October 2019<br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Project Area<br><br></td><td>  The Beaver River Watershed wetland map is located in east central Yukon and has a total area of 6,146 km2.

315,public,Government of Yukon,mailto:Geomatics.Help@yukon.ca,Geomatics Yukon,Places,,," The Yukon Geological Survey stores a significant amount of geological information gathered by exploration companies in compliance with the Quartz Mining Act. This information is primarily contained in assessment reports (AR). Since 1920, more than 8000 hardrock assessment reports have been collected, with more than 6000 of these containing geochemical data on surficial samples (e.g., soil, rock, stream sediment, and vegetation). The sheer volume and historical depth of these data provide valuable insight into the mineral potential of the Yukon. Exploration companies rely on data from ARs to search for exploration targets. To aid exploration companies, YGS has developed this database to consolidate geochemical data extracted from assessment reports. This database, the Geochemical Assessment Report Data Extracted database (GARDEd), was created by extracting and compiling data from more than 300 assessment reports. GARDEd was initially populated with data from samples within a 75 km radius of the Casino deposit to evaluate the data extraction procedures and assess the feasibility of the database. Data capture focused on recent ARs because these were available in digital format. The initial release of this database contains approximately 10% of the geochemical data from surface samples within Yukon ARs. <br><br> YGS encourages users to send feedback to <a href='mailto:%20geology@yukon.ca:25' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'> geology@yukon.ca</a>  to assess the usefulness of the dataset and determine how much effort should be invested to capture older, non-digital ARs. <br><br> Distributed from <a href='https://mapservices.gov.yk.ca:443/GeoYukon/' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'> GeoYukon </a> by the <a href='http://yukon.ca:80/' style='text-decoration:underline;' rel='nofollow ugc'> Government of Yukon</a> .

Original polygon size was limited to 200 hectares, when the first edition of this dataset was completed in 1997. Smaller fires are now being included, especially near communities. It is important to note that in most instances, fire perimeters only were mapped. This means that unburned areas within the perimeter are not accounted for, either in an ecological context or in annual area burned summaries. More recent fires mapped, with the aid of satellite technology may include large unburned patches.Although the temporal scale of the coverage goes back to late 1940's, Yukon-wide fire detection capability was not fully developed until the 1960's. In addition to this, access to regular aerial mapping was not readily available until that same time period. As a result many fires in the 40's and 50's were simply not recorded or poorly mapped, particularly in the north.
