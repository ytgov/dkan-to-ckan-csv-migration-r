pia-summaries,Traffic Classifiers,"Yukon's Department of Highways and Public Works, Transportation and Engineering Branch (TEB) is responsible for a variety of activities, including transportation planning, monitoring the condition of transportation infrastructure for planning and management purposes and road infrastructure safety analysis. As a part of carrying out these responsibilities, TEB leads and supports the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) within the Yukon Government (YG).

ITS is implementing a Traffic Classifier system (the"" System"") for the purpose of traffic safety analysis and improvement. The system consists of a camera (""Camera"") that captures live stream video, which is connected to the traffic classifier, the TrafficEmbedded unit. (""Unit""). The Unit contains an Al engine (FLOW) which analyzes the video stream and extracts data. These non-image traffic insights are then sent to a FLOW Insights dashboard for use within TEB. As soon as the image is processed, there is no longer any personal information included in the system, it is only analytics. A System visualization is attached in Appendix E.

The non-image traffic insights, containing no personal information, can also be sent on further and used for smart city platforms, LED signs and as a basis for signal/traffic lights control.

The purpose of the System is to capture how roads, sidewalks, airports, and multiuse trails are used and at what volume allow YG to make informed decisions regarding speeds, safety information and future planning. The System works by classifying the images from the Camera according to specific parameters. The classifications include large mammal, vehicle, plane, bike, person, and others. The System can count the number of each class, track trajectories, near misses and collisions between and among classes, speed, traffic violations, and more. The information can be used by TEB to make changes to traffic lights, automatically activate roadside signs or pedestrian signals and other safety related information. TEB can also use the information to understand the frequency of use of various roads and pathways.

The only personal information collected by the System is the live-stream video captured by the camera and fed into the Unit. This could be video of a person or of their vehicle. There is no storage of the image within the Camera or Unit. Once the video stream reaches the Unit there is no further transmission of the images. There is no ability to go into the System and pull historical video feeds. All analysis occurs in real-time, in milliseconds, within the Unit.
This is not a surveillance system, rather a classification and counting system.

During system set up and maintenance, access can be granted to the live video stream in order to configure conditions for analysis and to train the artificial intelligence in classifying images. There are two options for HPW-TEB staff to access the live feed, either they will need to take a computer to the traffic classifier location, or they can connect the traffic classifier to the internet and can then access the video feed via VPN. Data From Sky, the Unit creator, can also access the live video stream, only when their specific VPN is enabled by TEB staff, and assist in system configuration and troubleshooting. The video feed is not accessed on any sort of regular basis or used for other purposes.",Highways and Public Works,,OGL-Yukon-2.0,HPW-PIA-2022-01,2022-04-08,2022-04-20 09:34:43,2024-06-24 11:03:30,https://open.yukon.ca/access-information/privacy-impact-assessment-summary/traffic-classifiers,55114

It supports the Tourism and Culture purpose of supporting, protecting, promoting and enhancing Yukon’s tourism, culture, heritage and arts sectors for the benefit of Yukoners and visitors. 
The Photo Unit maintains a significant catalogue of digital media, including photos and videos, for promotional and marketing materials at YG. It has been using an on-premises solution for over 20 years, provided by Cumulus software. Since Cumulus will no longer be supporting this software, the Photo Unit is required to find an alternative software solution for their Digital Asset Management (DAM) needs. 
To replace the legacy system, Cumulus is shifting to a cloud-based solution. Canto Cumulus (“Canto”, https://www.canto.com) is a DAM software service that will allow for the collection, storage, organization, filtering, and searching of digital images, videos, and other media. The Photo Unit wishes to use this system to manage their inventory of digital media. Canto is seen as software for the 21st century and will allow for migration of the current digital assets from the on-premises software. 
A PIA for this software system has been deemed necessary because it will manage digital media which may display identifiable people. Names and other details of the individual are not included in the photos, or their meta data, unless the image is of an individual in their work capacity, such as a member of the YG cabinet or the name of a business owner whose photo is taken for promotion of that business.

pia-summaries,Auth0,"To manage the user authentication and log on to the Yukon Government (""YG"") online systems and services, YG has decided to use the Auth0 Authenticator to facilitate a Single Sign on (“SSO”). SSO occurs when a user logs in to one application and is then signed into other applications automatically, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain the user is using. Citizens or other users sign in in a single time and are then logged on to any of the affiliated systems/services they are authorized to utilize.
Auth0 will be used by YG staff (“Staff Users”) to manage the log-on process to multiple government systems, as well as by members of the public (“Public Users”) who require access to various YG government online services. Though the Staff and Public Users will follow largely the same process, they are discussed separately in the Privacy Impact Assessment to ensure that the differences are documented.

pia-summaries,Yukon Land Titles Registry,"History and current state 
The Land Titles Office (LTO) of the Department of Justice maintains public documents that are accessible to stakeholders (e.g., lawyers, land surveyors) and the public to conduct land titles-related transactions and searches under Yukon’s Torrens system1 of land registration. 
The increase in number and complexity of real estate transactions over the past 20+ years has resulted in strains on the processes and systems, including longer turnaround times for registrations, requests, and queries. These longer turnaround times have a direct and negative economic impact on professional stakeholders, developers, and members of the public. The LTO committed to modernizing and streamlining all aspects of its operations to allow staff to work to their full capacity and to meet the needs of stakeholders and the public more effectively. 
The LTO has conducted business using only manual, paper-based processes for over 100 years. The introduction of a database (Land Interest Management System, LIMS) about 20 years ago to record many government land interests across departments resulted in land titles information being entered into the database. LIMS is a centralized land information repository but is not a land-titles-specific system. LIMS did not eliminate manual examination or handling of submitted paper documents. Instead, it created additional work to transfer information from paper into the system. LIMS can compile certificates of title for land titles that are in its database. However, LIMS does not contain many cancelled titles or some active titles. Since the implementation in December 2019 of the Yukon Land Titles Registry (YLTR), ownership of LIMS has transferred to Energy, Mines and Resources, Lands Branch. 
In 2012, the Government of Yukon (YG) reviewed and analyzed the present state of the land titles systems in the Yukon and other Canadian jurisdictions: legislation, business processes, supporting computer platform, governance model, and financial/fee structure. This initiative included a full review of existing Yukon legislation, engagement with stakeholders, and business requirements gathering and analysis. 
In 2015, legislation review and stakeholder engagement resulted in a new Condominium Act, 2015 and Land Titles Act, 2015, which were passed by the Legislative Assembly. The Land Titles Act, 2015 has been proclaimed but the Condominium Act, 2015 has since been amended and awaits proclamation on October 1, 2022. 
Among other things, The Land Titles Act, 2015 enables business process changes that contribute to the LTO modernization. These changes include support for the move from the current paper-based system to an electronic system that can support the growth in complexity and volume of transactions as well as improvements to LTO business processes. 
The LTO currently consists of 11 employees including the Registrar, processes approximately 9000-10000 documents per year, and manages approximately 19,000 certificates of title. 
The LTO holds records dating from 1897 to present. These include original hand-written and word-processed records for all titles as well as a combination of microfilm, microfiche, and digital (LIMS) formats. 
The paper filing system for all original paper records consists of over 240,000 documents, which are filed numerically and stored in a physical vault. This system includes all documentation related to land titles. Document formats vary in size and include paper, survey plans, bound books, cross-reference and index books, and patents. 
The LTO has maintained a daybook since 1897 which records every instrument and caveat submitted for registration. From 1997 to 2019, the LTO has registered instruments and caveats manually in both the daybook and LIMS although only the entry in the daybook has legal effect. LTO staff entered a brief description of each instrument or caveat into LIMS and assigned the next sequential number to the instrument.
Since the implementation of the electronic registry on December 2, 2019, the Daybook is maintained by retaining a paper copy of every Document Registration Form and electronic reports that can be run detailing all registrations.
YG started a microfilm program in 1985 to microfilm original certificates of title, instruments, and daybooks. The YG Records Centre, which is in a different location than LTO, holds the master microfilm and master microfiche of land titles records while the LTO holds a microfilm/microfiche copy of the records. Certificates of title are microfiched (jacket system) and instruments are microfilmed (roll).
LTO registration fees are estimated by the system at the time of submission. Clients must provide payment either before services are provided or by way of maintaining a prepaid account with LTO. Fees and account balances are calculated, charged, and maintained electronically in the registry system. The system automatically creates and sends a monthly account balance statement for every account holder if there has been activity during that month or if the account holds a positive balance.
Anyone can request land titles information. Lawyers or surveyors are generally the ones who submit instruments or caveats for registration but members of the public may also do so. Requests for registration currently arrive in person at the LTO, and by mail; LTO also accepts requests for information (but not requests for registration) in person, by phone, and by email. LTO staff members process the paper documents, enter information into the registry system, and then file the registered instruments or caveats in the vault as required by legislation.
Future state
Most interactions require a secure, online solution. LTO staff have eliminated many administrative tasks such as paper handling, filing, and billing, and therefore have time to provide improved customer service to clients who require additional service or have complex questions that are not supported by the online tools. LTO staff have well-defined roles and expectations of service delivery.
The public and customers can access information via secure, online, self-serve tools to complete most tasks. Basic administrative tasks such as status inquiries and document submissions are automated. The LTO communicates changes to procedures broadly and consistently. Customers receive rapid responses to queries from trained staff.
The ongoing Land Titles Modernization project contains plans to formalize the return of paper documents to submitters and recognize the scanned electronic version as the authoritative record.
All LTO registry information is available online and via data interfaces for use by other YG departments.",Justice,,OGL-Yukon-2.0,JUS-PIA-2022-01,2022-05-17,2022-05-24 12:55:43,2022-05-24 12:55:43,https://open.yukon.ca/access-information/privacy-impact-assessment-summary/yukon-land-titles-registry,56515

pia-summaries,Sexualized Assault Response Team (SART),"In 2020, the Yukon Government, in collaboration with several community agencies who provide services to victims of sexualized assault, launched the Sexualized Assault Response Team (“SART”). The Department of Health and Social Services (“HSS”) is one of seven SART agencies committed to providing a coordinated and collaborative response for all individuals victimized by sexualized violence and to 
support them moving forward along whichever path of services they choose. 

While the community agencies are involved in the governance and management of SART through a number of committees including the SART Implementation Committee, the SART Oversight Committee, and the SART Protocol and Training Management Committee, these committees are not involved in the day-to-day operations, data collection, or working with the individual unless that individual has consented to be referred to that agency or they choose to access those agencies on their own. The key agencies that make up SART are: Department of Health and Social Services (“HSS”); Department of Justice; the Women and Gender Equity Directorate; the Women’s Transition Home; RCMP – M Division; Yukon Hospital Corporation; and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. 

Within HSS, the launch of the Yukon SART in 2020 saw the formation of a specific SART program unit within the broader Community Health Programs branch. This included the establishment of an individual’s forensic record associated with a sexualized assault being kept independent from their personal medical/health record for the protection of the individual’s privacy. The SART Clinical Coordinator role within HSS Community Health Programs includes retaining the individual's forensic record separate from their health record at Whitehorse General Hospital, providing system navigation services to individuals, facilitating collection and disclosure of the individual's forensic record across participating organizations based on the individual's consent (e.g., to the RCMP), and responsible for the overall clinical operations of the SART.",Health and Social Services,,OGL-Yukon-2.0,HSS-PIA-2022-04,2022-05-31,2022-07-15 11:25:37,2022-07-15 11:27:57,https://open.yukon.ca/access-information/privacy-impact-assessment-summary/sexualized-assault-response-team-sart,56616
pia-summaries,Coordinated Access,"In response to the growing need for supports for Clients experiencing homelessness, the Yukon Government (“YG”) Department of Health and Social Services (“HSS”) is participating in the Coordinated Access program (“CA”). CA is a standardized approach to assessing a homeless Client or family’s needs and providing the services and supports they may require to achieve housing stability. The CA program is 
funded in part by the Canadian Federal Government through the Reaching Home program. All organizations, non-profits, governments, and societies that receive funding through the Reaching Home program are required to participate in the CA program and are required to be a member of the Coordinated Housing Access Team (“CHAT”) and participate in the CHAT Table. The CA program streamlines access to housing and supports for homeless Clients and families, through a “no wrong door” model of care. Clients in need of housing can present at any CA Partner Agency and can begin the intake process to receive services or supports. In most cases, the Client will be a client of the CA Partner Agency with whom they completed their consent for the By-Name-List (“BNL”). 

The CA program in Yukon is overseen by Safe at Home (“SAH”), a Society under the Yukon Societies Act. YG HSS does not oversee or manage the CA program but is a participant. SAH manages the BNL, which is a key component of the CA Program. The BNL is a centralized list of Clients in need of housing within the Yukon. Clients who have consented to being placed on the BNL will have their cases discussed at the CHAT Table, with the goal of finding the best housing option for their specific situation. Placement on the BNL is contingent on the Client completing the Vulnerability Index - Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (“VI-SPDAT”). The VI-SPDAT is a triage tool that helps identify who should be recommended for each housing and support intervention, and the urgency of their needs. 

Participating HSS program areas conduct the VI-SPDAT with their clients only and communicates the result (the VI-SPDAT number) to Safe at Home for placement on the BNL. HSS areas can be referral sites, which includes the completion of the VI-SPDAT. HSS does not share the responses provided by the Client or a copy of the VI-SPDAT questionnaire outside of the Department. If the other Partner Agencies want their Client to complete a VI-SPDAT assessment they will forward the request to Safe At Home to complete with the Client. 

Currently, there is no electronic information system related to the CA Program, however, SAH is planning to utilize the Homeless Individuals and Families Information System (HIFIS). HIFIS is a federally provided client information management system. It should be noted that though the program is funded by the federal government, and they have provided guidance and obligations to the receiving organization, there is no transfer of personally identifiable data to the federal government for the purposes of the Coordinated Access program.

Environmental Health Services (EHS) is responsible for the regulatory process for the issuances of Permits to Install Sewage Disposal Systems in Yukon Territory. An approved Sewage Disposal System is required for all decentralized waste disposal systems, these systems serve all buildings that are not connected to community waste collection infrastructure.

EHS is implementing a new electronic information system, the “Sewage Disposal Permitting System (SDPS)”, which includes functionalities such as receiving applications, managing files, conducting assessments, managing correspondence, issuing permits, collecting fees, recording decision outcomes and monitoring. The system will replace an existing MS Excel and paper based system. Once implemented the system will allow installers and homeowners to submit applications for sewage disposal permits online (the name “portal” will be used to describe this online interface) and will be able to receive the required documentation and payments from applicants. The system will also allow EHS staff to manage the application, assessment, correspondence, and authorization information for the applicants.

pia-summaries,Supervised Consumption Site,"Nationally, opioid and other substance use rates have increased steadily over the past decade. The increase in use rates, coupled with other factors such as unsafe illegal supply and the Covid-19 pandemic, has led to an increase in injury and overdoses. The rate of the injury and overdose resulting from substance use has led many jurisdictions throughout Canada to open Supervised Consumption Sites (“SCS”) as a way of reducing harm directly and indirectly resulting from substance use. 

SCS are medically supervised facilities that provide a safer, hygienic environment in which individuals can consume drugs under the supervision of a health care professional without the risk of arrest for drug possession. Individuals consume their substances under the supervision of a staff member who is trained to spot the signs of, and reverse, overdose. SCS do not provide the substances. SCS operate based on an approved temporary or permanent exemption issued by Health Canada. 

SCS have seen success in lowering overdose, hospitalization, and death rates, as well as providing support services (such as counselling, medical treatment, and detox) to populations that have been historically hard to reach with government sponsored programs. Yukon has not been immune to this increase in user rates and, to quote Yukon’s then Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brendan Hanley on April 22, 2021 ""The pace of opioid deaths [in Yukon] is continuing at a terrifying rate"". In 2020 the Department of Health and Social Services (“HSS”), Mental Wellness and Substance Use Services (“MWSU”) Branch was mandated to create a SCS program for the health and safety of individuals. The opening of the SCS is supported by Dr. Hanley who stated on April 22, 2021: “This may seem like it's endorsing or supporting drug use, but in fact what happens is that overdoses are prevented and people do get connected to supports, medical care counselling, access to treatment"".

pia-summaries,"Licensing, Inspections and Permitting System (LIPS)","Yukon Liquor Corporation (YLC) is designated as the distributor corporation for cannabis in the Yukon pursuant to the ""Cannabis Control and Regulation Act"", and as the distributor corporation for liquor in the Yukon pursuant to the ""Liquor Act"". YLC is therefore responsible for the collection of information related to cannabis and liquor license and permit applications, to provide to the Cannabis Licensing Board at the Liquor Licensing Board (""the Boards"") for decision-making. 

The Regulatory Service branch within YLC prepares analyses of applications for the review of the Boards, administers all aspects of licensing services, and enforces the Cannabis Control and Regulation Act, Liquor Act, and their regulations. YG is in the process of designing and implementing a new ""licensing, inspections and permitting system"" (LIPS or the ""System"") for YLC. LIPS includes the functionalities of receiving applications, managing files, conducting assessments, conducting consultations, managing correspondence, issuing licenses and permits, collecting fees, and monitoring enforcement.

The contract for development of LIPS has been awarded, and the software application is named Amanda, the vendor being Calytera. The proposed system will replace the current MS Access and paper-based system. The proposed system once implemented will allow businesses to submit applications for liquor and cannabis licenses and permits online and to receive the required documentation and payments from the businesses. This will allow for increased efficiency, accuracy and information security for the licensing and permitting processes within YLC.

YLC users will manage the application, assessment, correspondence, and authorization information for the businesses that apply. Migration of data from the existing MS Access and paper-based system to the new system will be completed once LIPS is operational.

pia-summaries,Archives Digital Transfer Tool,"This project is to start a new service to expand the disposition process to include transfer of digital public records from public bodies to Yukon Archives.

The Yukon Archives is mandated under the Archives Act to acquire and give appropriate access to public records in all formats. The Archives, Records Centre and Departmental Records Officers have well established procedures for transfer of public records. However, currently only analogue records (paper, video and audio tapes, etc.) are being transferred because the Archives does not have the ability to securely transfer digital records.

Methods such as Secure File Transfer (SFT) or using digital carriers such as external hard drives do exist but are undesirable and are not used. For example, SFT limits the size of transfers and strips metadata, lessening the authenticity of the records. Digital carriers introduce unnecessary risk as they remove records from the secure YG environment and can be easily misplaced. Metadata is also changed when using this method and workarounds (such as digital forensic techniques) are complicated and resource heavy.

At the last government transition in 2016 there was attempt to transfer digital records from the Executive Council Office to the Archives through the use of a shared folder. This did not proceed and only analogue records were transferred at that time. In January 2020, Yukon Archives hired a new Digital Archivist. One of their priorities is to work with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to develop a secure method to transfer digital records. The Digital Archivist has been working closely with Govern Records Archivists to review, and adapt if necessary, the disposition and transfer process to better include digital records.",Tourism and Culture,,OGL-Yukon-2.0,TC-PIA-2021-01,2021-01-19,2022-07-21 15:14:15,2022-07-21 15:14:15,https://open.yukon.ca/access-information/privacy-impact-assessment-summary/archives-digital-transfer-tool,56630

Pursuant to the Yukon Languages Act, Government of Yukon departments and corporations must provide services and information in French to the public.
Public events such as workshops or information sessions are typically delivered in English only. Departments report that offering them in French can be challenging. Currently, this can be done either by enlisting a French-speaking facilitator and delivering a session in French, or flying in professional interpreters from outside the territory.
In the last 3 or 4 years, the market for conference interpretation has transformed as digital solutions became viable options for sustainable and flexible service offering. Interactio is a European company that provides such a service.
Interactio, a Lithuanian company, developed an app that provides live interpretation services for public presentations. The app lets users listen to a live audio translation (provided by interpreters working remotely) of a presentation on their own device. Since the translated
audio feed is cloud-based, attendees can tune in from anywhere in the world.
Interactio is compliant with the Association of International Conference Interpreters, who sets the standards for quality assurance in conference interpretation.
FLSD will establish a contract with Interactio and offer the app as a corporate solution to departments. Interactio can help YG overcome current challenges related to increasing French-language access to public.

Part of this program development is the replacement of 511. TEB have historically been providers of bridge and highway work exclusively across Yukon, however, the branch has expanded with a team for ITS development and deployment. This team supports, leads and implements ITS projects across the Transportation Division and YG.
The Transportation Maintenance Branch (TMB) supports Yukon's multi-modal transportation systems. This is done with YG staff maintaining roads to a level that ensures safe and efficient use. Between TEB and TMB, is the management of highway rights-of-way and other lands and assets required for transportation purposes. Both branches develop and maintain 4,821 kilometers of Yukon roads.
YG currently has 11 highways and Yukon has a population of approximately 40,000, majority of which reside in Whitehorse. Most communities have cell connectivity, however, along most highways there is no cell service. Yukon's highways connect to British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Alaska. Temperatures can vary between -50C and +30C through the year. 
Currently, 511Yukon.ca is managed externally using the Telenium 511 system. This system is outdated and not adaptive to the constant technological change, and staff and public expectations of such a system.
YG requires a new Advanced Traveller Information Management System (ATIMS) to replace and improve upon the existing 511 Yukon platform, increase efficiencies on data management and provide a safety-driven, user-friendly interface to the public.
The development and evolution of the new Yukon 511 solution is an integral part of the Territory's future long-term transportation strategy. The new Yukon 511 is a cloud-based software called Travel-iQ provided and developed by IBI Group (IBI). The new Yukon 511 provides a secure, modern and supported system that provides centralized data management and a user-friendly ATIMS.

*road condition and traffic management;
*incident management;
*road and weather information systems;
*traffic control and management;
*work zone safety;
*Weight and bridge management; and
*data collection and management.
This new functionality includes providing detail information collected from various infrastructure elements put in place by the TEB ITS team, such as Mini road weather information systems, a data logger for roadbed temperature senor, radar traffic classifiers and traffic cameras. The information is then laid out on a visual map of the Yukon, allowing the public to see events, alerts, road closures and much more information.
A part of the new Yukon 511 system includes the ability for users to create an account if they wish. A user account is not required to use the Yukon 511 system. if a user signs up for an account, it allows for the user to create and save customized routes, create and save alerts for routes, create and save emergency alerts, set map layer preferences and personalize the camera view function (to display specific camera images).
No personal information is purposefully collected by any of the ITS infrastructure discussed above. however, the traffic cameras may inadvertently collect a person's image or an image of their vehicle. Please see the Traffic Cameras PIA for additional information.

Historically, operators have submitted completed forms by email, mail or fax to the branch and information is saved on YG network drives. This process is inefficient because it is difficult for staff to track which Operator has submitted what report and makes it impractical, if not impossible to compile and map ground disturbance by area Furthermore, MRB has no control over the format and the quality of information being submitted.

Employee information—such as first and last name, email address, Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL), phone number, badge number, and Pleasure Craft Operator Card—is collected through FormStack, a previously assessed data collection platform.
