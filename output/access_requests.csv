NARROWED REQUEST BASED ON ACCESS INFORMATION SUMMARY:
Narrow request to only include records from the Investigations & Standards Office.

Notes from public body: The revised estimated volume for any work on reducing the volume or scope of the estimated volume of records for the current Estimate of Cost for just the Investigations and Standards Office program area is: 428 pages. There is information in the records subject to the protection of privacy exemption to disclosure provision found in section 70 and 70(1) of the ATIPP Act which will not be
disclosed to protect personal privacy.

Narrowing #2:
Further narrow this request so that the timeframe is June 1, 2019, to Feb. 20, 2022.

Notes from public body: The new estimated page count, with the new revised date range will now be: 356 pages.

Narrowing #3:
Narrow my request so the date range is Jan. 1, 2020 to Feb. 20, 2022.

Notes from public body: The revised estimated page count for this new date range for ISO records is: 338 Pages from Investigations and Standards Office (ISO).

Narrowing #4
I'd like to narrow the request to April 1, 2020 - to Feb. 22, 2022.

Notes from the public body: The revised estimated page count for ISO records is now: 329 pages.

Narrowing #5
Further narrow the timeframe to only include records from June 1, 2020 to Feb. 22, 2022.

Notes from the public body: The estimated page count remains at 329 pages. For the applicant’s information, as they are trying to exclude records based on a time period: The remaining 329 pages remaining start with emails from November 19 2020.

Narrowing #6
Further narrow so the date range starts on Jan. 1, 2021. 

Notes from the public body: The revised estimated page count for the new date range of Jan 1 2021 through to Feb 22 2022 is: 323 pages.

Further Narrowing #7
Do you know the date range for which responsive records actually exist? Narrow again so that there's no cost associated with processing this request, and that provide a better idea of how far I need to narrow.

Notes from public body: The date range for which records actually exist is the original date range. Did the applicant want to just ask for the most recent records which stop at or before 300 pages? We can likely do that, but, (page numbers are illustrative not actual) page 299 might not make any sense without pages 300-323 – we have not reviewed the records, just counted pages and dates. We could ensure that we have an inclusive record which ends up to the pages below the threshold. For example: an email and attachment that starts on page 277 and goes to page 285; not the following email and attachments which are from page 286 to 306. 

Applicant’s Response: I'd like to take the public body's suggestion. I would like to ask for the most recent records which stop before or at 300 pages, and for the records to be inclusive (i.e. the department's example of an email and attachment that starts on page 277 and goes to page 285; not the following email and attachments which are from page 286 to 306.)

CLARIFICATION:  The information I requested between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, is not in the schedule 9 to the 2019-20 Public Accounts.

My request asked specifically for ""...and a precise description of what exactly each funding amount was for."" There is no such description in the Public Accounts.

I am concerned that this misinterpretation of my request by the department will lead to a delay in results as I will have to file a new ATIPP request.

Can I ask for clarification please that the Department has read and understood every part of the request made?

FURTHER CLARIFICATION:  I think the easiest way for me to clarify is to give an example. 

The Public Accounts say ""Incubation program development - $85,000."" I have no idea what ""incubation program development"" means.
