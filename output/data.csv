data,Beaver and muskrat - wildlife key area - 250k,"<div style=""text-align:Left;"">

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

data,Surficial Geology Polygon 250k,"The Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) has compiled over 195 surficial geology maps into a standardized GIS format, providing approximately 80% coverage of the territory. The maps range in scales from 1:250,000 to 1:10,000 with spatial overlap between scales. The original maps were produced by various agencies, including the Geological Survey of Canada, YGS, Yukon Government, universities, and the City of Whitehorse.  
  
All original feature descriptions have been preserved and also converted to standardized values using the Yukon terrain classification system. The compilation includes 4 GIS datasets and supporting documents available for download via <a href=""https://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/Compilation/33"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">YGS integrated data system</a> (YGSIDS) or GeoYukon. A .lyr file is <a href=""https://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/Compilation/33"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">provided</a> to symbolize feature classes and differentiate overlapping maps at different scales. Additionally, there is a surficial geology map index.  
  
The polygon attributes captured include surficial material, texture, age, surface expression, and geomorphological processes.  
  
Line features include geological contacts, glacial limits, glacial landforms (cirques, arêtes, eskers, meltwater channels, moraines), and non-glacial landforms (faults, lineaments, landslides, escarpments).  
  
Point features include field station, fossil and sample locations, glacial landforms (erratics, kames, kettles, drumlins, flutings), permafrost features (pingos, palsas, patterned ground, thermokarst depressions), and other non-glacial landforms (landslides, tors).  
  
The map index provides information on each map publication such as author, map title, map scale, publisher.  
  
These data are valuable for land-use applications in the territory, including: mineral and placer exploration, geotechnical engineering, infrastructure planning, granular resource assessments, permafrost modeling, agricultural assessments, forest management, and biophysical or ecological land classification.

Broad Ecosystem Units (BEU) are a level in the Yukon bioclimate ecosystem classification system that represents areas with similar broad vegetation communities, terrain type (soils and topography) within bioclimate zones. Broad Ecosystem Units are described in the accompanying report ""Regional Ecosystems of West-Central Yukon, Part 1: Ecosystem descriptions "".The intended application for mapped broad ecosystem units is 1:100,000 or smaller (1:100,000 - 1:250,000 scale) - interpretations derived from the map products should not be applied at more detailed scales, even though the resultant 30m raster map allows users to view results at more detailed resolutions. With new information, boundaries and designations of Broad Ecosystem Units can change. Updates to Broad Ecosystem Units occur only periodically. For the most current information, or if you have questions, please contact the Ecological and Landscape Classification Program (ELC@yukon.ca).

data,Regional Geochemical Surveys - RGS - INAA - 250k,"Regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation  
  
November 2020  
  
Release notes  
  
The regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation comprises data for more than 30 000 samples across Yukon. This compilation updates the work of Héon (2003). This new compilation includes results from the reanalysis of more than 24 000 samples; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis provides upgraded detection limits and a broader range of elements relative to previous analytical data. In addition to analytical data, efforts have been made to improve sample location accuracy. The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:  
  

1.  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.  
      
2.  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in Héon (2003) with minor updates to sample location.  
      
3.  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.  
      
4.  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.  
      
5.  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).  
      
6.  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.  
      

Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below.  
  
For atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using Lefort aqua regia or concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.  
  
For instrumental neutron activation analysis ( INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.  
  
For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment ( the minus 0.177 mm fraction) ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.  
  
Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey. Your feedback contributes to improving the accuracy of the geoscience databases for Yukon.

- Forest resources road (Act): a road constructed, modified or maintained for the purpose of providing access for forest resources harvesting or management of forest resources that is authorized under subsection 32(1) of the Act, or a road designated as forest resources road under section 73 of the Regulation. These roads were constructed or designated after the Forest Resources Act and Regulation were enacted.  
    
- Forest resource access (non-Act): a road constructed, modified or maintained for the purpose of providing access for forest resources harvesting or management of forest resources that is considered a capital investment by the Government of Yukon, Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, Forest Management Branch. These roads were constructed prior to the enactment of the Forest Resources Act.  
    
- Public Access (non act): a pre-existing public road. In this road network all Public Access is part of the forest resource access network.

data,Faults,"Yukon Bedrock Geology MapThis update of the Yukon bedrock geology map builds upon the previous compilation by Gordey and Makepeace (1999, 2001). It includes new, detailed bedrock geology maps and regional compilations that have been published by the Yukon Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada between 1999 and 2015, as well as some recent thesis works. A few of these maps were partially integrated into the digital dataset by Gordey and Makepeace (2003), but only as overlay to the 1999 compilation. A number of errors and omissions from the 1999 compilation of Gordey and Makepeace were also noted and corrected during compilation of this version of the map. The Yukon bedrock geology GIS dataset is regularly updated and can be downloaded from the Yukon Geological Survey's website: www.geology.gov.yk.ca. Users are advised to consult the website regularly to ensure they are working with the latest version of the geodatabase or shape files. This update of the GIS dataset includes an expanded attribute structure (compared to the 1999 dataset) that facilitates searching of the geodatabase. The Yukon Geological Survey aims to provide users with the best available geoscience data for Yukon. Any revisions or additional geological information known to the user would be welcomed by the Yukon Geological Survey.

data,Waterbodies - 1M,"The Waterbodies dataset is comprised of area features: lakes, intermittent waterbodies, islands, and rivers wide enough to be represented as an area feature (e.g. St. Lawrence River, Mackenzie River). In a few exceptional cases, islands had to be represented by ""holes"" in the polygons in the Waterbodies dataset. Some area features have been subdivided and several types of virtual linear features serve to separate them. Features in this dataset are linked (by an attribute) to their corresponding flow line in the Drainage Network Skeleton. Therefore the Waterbodies dataset may be used in conjunction with the Drainage Network Skeleton for analytical applications. The Islands dataset is comprised of area and linear features: islands within inland waters and the waterbodies and single line rivers within these islands. Oceanic islands are not included as they are part of the coastline component of the Drainage Network Skeleton dataset. The Islands dataset exists to complete the cartographic representation of Canadian hydrology. The Islands dataset is not logically connected with the Drainage Network Skeleton, and can not be used for analytical applications. It should be noted that flow lines of the Drainage Network Skeleton do not take into account of the existence of islands and therefore do not necessarily flow around them. In a few exceptional cases, islands had to be represented by ""holes"" in the polygons in the Waterbodies dataset. Some islands themselves contain waterbodies and rivers, not significant for network analysis. However, in order to support a complete cartographic representation such waterbodies and rivers have been added to the Islands dataset. The National Scale Frameworks Hydrology data consists of area, linear and point geospatial and attribute data for Canada's hydrology at a national scale. It provides a representation of Canada's surface water features, and data completeness reflects the content of the source, the original Vector Map level 0 (VMAP0) revision 4 hydrographic layers, except where revision editing has been performed. Key value-added characteristics include river flow direction, connectivity and the tagging of geographical name keys to selected rivers, lakes and islands included in the Concise Gazetteer of Canada.  
  
The Atlas Frameworks are a set of integrated base map layers which form part of a larger National Scale Frameworks data collection. These data have been compiled at a scale of 1:1 000 000 with the primary goal being to indicate correct relative positioning with other framework layers rather than absolute positional accuracy.

data,Surficial Geology Line Age 100k,"The Yukon Geological Survey (YGS) has compiled over 195 surficial geology maps into a standardized GIS format, providing approximately 80% coverage of the territory. The maps range in scales from 1:250,000 to 1:10,000 with spatial overlap between scales. The original maps were produced by various agencies, including the Geological Survey of Canada, YGS, Yukon Government, universities, and the City of Whitehorse.  
  
All original feature descriptions have been preserved and also converted to standardized values using the Yukon terrain classification system. The compilation includes 4 GIS datasets and supporting documents available for download via <a href=""https://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/Compilation/33"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">YGS integrated data system</a> (YGSIDS) or GeoYukon. A .lyr file is <a href=""https://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/Compilation/33"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">provided</a> to symbolize feature classes and differentiate overlapping maps at different scales. Additionally, there is a surficial geology map index.  
  
The polygon attributes captured include surficial material, texture, age, surface expression, and geomorphological processes.  
  
Line features include geological contacts, glacial limits, glacial landforms (cirques, arêtes, eskers, meltwater channels, moraines), and non-glacial landforms (faults, lineaments, landslides, escarpments).  
  
Point features include field station, fossil and sample locations, glacial landforms (erratics, kames, kettles, drumlins, flutings), permafrost features (pingos, palsas, patterned ground, thermokarst depressions), and other non-glacial landforms (landslides, tors).

Drainage area definitions for both WSC and Atlas of Canada boundaries were reviewed resulting in some modifications. Larger scale reference data sources were used for further manual boundary adjustments. This dataset has been integrated with other National Scale Frameworks hydrology datasets and is considered a component of the Hydrology Theme (see Supplemental Information for more details about the Atlas of Canada National Frameworks data at the 1:1,000,000 scale).  
  
The Atlas Frameworks are a set of integrated base map layers which form part of a larger National-Scale Frameworks data collection. These data have been compiled at a scale of 1:1 000 000 with the primary goal being to indicate correct relative positioning with other framework layers rather than absolute positional accuracy.

data,Geothermal Radiogenic Heat Production,"Background:  
  
More than 80% of the heat produced in the Earth's crust comes from granitoid rocks. When granitoid rocks form they naturally concentrate radioactive elements such as U, Th, and K, and the radiogenic decay of these elements is an exothermic reaction. The radioactive decay of these elements within a granitoid body may generate local heat anomalies and elevated geothermal gradient at relatively shallow crustal levels. In combination with other local rock properties (e.g, porosity, permeability, thermal conductivity), radiogenic heat has the potential to generate a geothermal resource. The decay of radioactive elements converts mass into radiation energy, which in turn gets converted to heat. While all naturally radioactive isotopes generate some heat, significant heat generation only occurs from the decay of 238 U ,235 U ,232 Th and 40 K. Therefore, potential heat production is governed by the concentrations of U ,Th and K in the rock. In igneous rocks, radiogenic heat production is dependent on the bulk chemistry of the rock and decreases from acidic (e.g. granite) through basic to ultra basic rock types. Therefore, granites with anomalously high concentrations of U ,Th and K are targets for calculating potential radiogenic heat production. Potential radiogenic heat production (A)from plutonic rocks can be calculated using this equation:  
  
A (\u03BCW/m 3 )=10 -5 \u1D29 (9.52c u +2.56c K +3.48c Th )  
  
where ""c"" is the concentration of radioactive elements ""U"" and ""Th"" in ppm, and ""K"" in %; and ""\u1D29"" is the rock density. Heat production constants of the natural radio-elements U, Th, K are 9.525x10 -5 , 2.561x10 -5 and 3.477x10 -9 W/kg, respectively.  
  
Data and Methods:  
  
Geochemical data from ~1760 samples of plutonic rocks from Yukon are used to calculate potential heat production. The calculated values for radiogenic heat production (A) are plotted over the mapped distribution of Paleozoic and younger plutonic rocks and major crustal faults are also shown for reference.

data,Fire Ignition Locations,"This is point GIS coverage consisting of either fire ignition locations or centroids of fire polygons where the exact location of fire ignition were unknown for fires within the Yukon, spanning a period from 1946 to present. Although the temporal scale of the coverage goes back to late 1940's, Yukon-wide fire detection capability was not fully developed until the 1960's. In addition to this, access to regular aerial mapping was not readily available until that same time period. As a result many fires in the 40's and 50's were simply not recorded or poorly mapped, particularly in the north. For that reason, care must be taken when drawing conclusions from these data as it relates to the early years. Starting 2020 on the data was automatically updated using iFMS.

Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

data,Terranes,"The framework of the Cordilleran orogen of northwestern North America is commonly depicted as a 'collage' of terranes - crustal blocks containing records of a variety of geodynamic environments including continental fragments, pieces of island arc crust and oceanic crust.  
  
The series of maps available here are derived from a GIS compilation of terranes based on the map first published by Colpron et al. (2007) and more recently revised by Nelson et al. (2013). These maps are presented here in digital formats including ArcGIS file geodatabase (.gdb), shapefiles (.shp and related files), Google Earth (.kmz), as well as graphic files (.pdf). The GIS data includes terrane polygons and selected major Late Cretaceous and Tertiary strike-slip faults. Graphic PDF files derived from the GIS compilation were prepared for the Northern Cordillera (Alaska, Yukon and BC), the Canadian Cordillera (BC and Yukon), Yukon, and British Columbia. These maps are intended for page-size display (~1:5,000,000 and smaller). Polygons are accurate to ~1 km for Yukon and BC, ~5 km for Alaska. More detailed geological data are available from both BCGC, USGS and YGS websites. Descriptions of the terranes, their tectonic evolution and metallogeny can be found in Colpron et al. (2007), Nelson and Colpron (2007), Colpron and Nelson (2009), Nelson et al. (2013) and references therein.  
  
The terrane map project is a collaborative effort of the BC Geological Survey and the Yukon Geological Survey.

data,Yukon Sulphide Pb and S Isotope Compilation,"This compilation includes S (1251 analyses) and Pb (1622 analyses) isotopic data from nearly 450 mineral occurrences. Approximately 300 of these occurrences are located in Yukon and the remainder are located in British Columbia, Alaska or Northwest Territories. To facilitate data interpretation, a hierarchical deposit model scheme and mineralization age are ascribed to each occurrence.  
  
The Pb isotope portion of this compilation builds upon the compilation by Collin Godwin (1988) that was subsequently maintained by the University of British Columbia. Data from Alaska are primarily from the Gaccetta and Church (1989) compilation.  
  
This dataset is designed to be used in conjunction with a GIS platform and as such is presented here as a ""flat file"" (i.e., shapefile, geodatabase and text formats). The simple data structure allows for easier integration into GIS platforms and greater spatial querying of the data.  
  
This sulphide isotope database will be subject to periodic updates as new data are acquired through ongoing mapping, exploration and other research activities. Any errors, omissions or new data known to users should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey. Your feedback contributes to improving the accuracy of the geoscience databases for Yukon.

data,Wolf - Wildlife Key Area - 250k,"<div style=""text-align:Left;"">

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

data,Regional Geochemical Surveys - RGS - Heon - 250k,"Regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation  
  
November 2020  
  
Release notes  
  
The regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation comprises data for more than 30 000 samples across Yukon. This compilation updates the work of Héon (2003). This new compilation includes results from the reanalysis of more than 24 000 samples; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis provides upgraded detection limits and a broader range of elements relative to previous analytical data. In addition to analytical data, efforts have been made to improve sample location accuracy. The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:  
  

1.  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.  
      
2.  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in Héon (2003) with minor updates to sample location.  
      
3.  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.  
      
4.  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.  
      
5.  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).  
      
6.  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.  
      

Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below.  
  
For atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using Lefort aqua regia or concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.  
  
For instrumental neutron activation analysis ( INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.  
  
For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment ( the minus 0.177 mm fraction) ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.  
  
Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey. Your feedback contributes to improving the accuracy of the geoscience databases for Yukon.

data,Ecoregions 2014 - 1M,"Ecoregions of Yukon, 2014 is an update to the Yukon portion of the 1995 National Ecological Framework (NEF) described in Ecoregions of Yukon (Smith et al 2004). Because of people's familiarity with the 1995 NEF, and its use in management and planning, these ecoregion revisions attempted to retain the 1995 divisions unless there were compelling reasons to change them. In Yukon there were several compelling reasons to revise the 1995 NEF: 1) capitalize on availability of digital inventory and knowledge and improve or adjust the 1995 mapping as necessary, 2) harmonize stratification along jurisdictional borders, 3) incorporate line work updates to the Soil Landscape polygons by Agriculture and AgriFood Canada (AAFC) happening concurrently, and 4) include Yukon revisions in a national update of NEF ecozones across Canada - led by Environment Canada (CCEA 2017).  
  
Mapping the ecoregions of Yukon is largely a top-down process and the divisional hierarchy is nested. The lowest level of the hierarchy is the Soil Landscapes of Canada unit (Soil Landscape Component, or SLC). SLCs are organized according to a uniform set of national soil and landscape criteria that are based on permanent natural attributes. SLCs polygons are not published in this release. Ecozones, ecoregions and ecodistricts are subdivisions at the continental scale of climatic zones; attention to physiography increases as map scale increases. There are many reasonable ways to distinguish Yukon ecoregions. Ecoregions are delineated principally on abiotic features, such as bedrock geology, glacial history and physiography, and so are relatively stable (i.e. enduring) over time. While considering changes to the 1995 NEF, the project team continued to recognize major physiographic and climatic distinctions. At the ecozone level the team included a stronger regional climate element and related the ecozone level to the bioclimate framework.  
  
The Ecoregions of Yukon concept is used for broad scale management applications. Its structure helps define ecologically relevant management units at various scales. The Ecoregions of the Yukon Territory (Smith et al. 2004) describes Yukon's ecozones and ecoregions represented in the 1995 NEF (ESWG 1995). This reference continues to be a useful and relevant resource the Ecoregions of Yukon, 2014. For a fulsome treatment of the updates in the Ecoregions of Yukon, 2014 please refer to the report ""Ecoregions of Yukon: Revisions to the Yukon portion of the National Ecological Framework."" (McKenna, K, J. Meikle and N. Flynn 2014).

data,CMI Water Quality Sampling Sites,"The Fish Habitat Management System for Yukon Placer Mining replaced the Yukon Place Authorization (YPA) in 15 Yukon watersheds on April 11, 2008. Founded on principles of adaptive management and incorporating a risk-based approach to decision-making, the system is intended to balance the objectives of a sustainable Yukon placer mining industry with the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat supporting fisheries Adaptive management recognizes that the effectiveness of any management system is hampered by a degree of uncertainty and lack of knowledge. It seeks to improve the system by monitoring the effects of management actions, in order to learn from the results. The Adaptive Management Framework for Yukon placer mining is complemented by traditional knowledge and water quality objectives monitoring, aquatic health monitoring and economic health monitoring programs. The results should provide new information and a rational basis for making any adjustments required to achieve the two management objectives. The water quality objectives monitoring program is governed by the Water Quality Objectives Monitoring Protocol. The Protocol describes the locations, timing, frequency and methods employed during sampling, as well as the methods used to analyze sampling data. Precipitation data was collected from a variety of sources to assist in the interpretation of results. The water quality objectives monitoring program relies upon both continuous sampling and grab sampling. Continuous sampling is performed by automated instruments that pump water from the creek or river at a preset volume and at precise times each day. Grab samples are taken by personnel at a selected location, depth and time. Normally the quantity of water taken is sufficient for all the physical and chemical analyses that will be done on the sample. Grab sampling is also performed during sampling ""blitzes"", when single grab samples are collected from as many sites as possible within a short timeframe in order to get a snapshot of the water quality in a watershed over a 24 hour period.

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

data,Watercourses - 1M,"Atlas of Canada National Frameworks data are standardized national coverages of commonly used geospatial datasets at the 1:1 000 000 scale. The Drainage Network Skeleton dataset is comprised of linear features: single line rivers, flow lines within waterbodies and ocean coastlines. Flow lines within waterbodies are virtual linear features representing the hydrological flow through area features (e.g. lakes, rivers and intermittent waterbodies). These flow lines complete the linear network where rivers would run through lakes, permitting hydrologic network analysis and cartographic generalization. This dataset is required for analytical applications. The coastline component of the Drainage Network Skeleton also delineates oceanic islands. The National Scale Frameworks Hydrology data consists of area, linear and point geospatial and attribute data for Canada's hydrology at a national scale. It provides a representation of Canada's surface water features, and data completeness reflects the content of the source, the original Vector Map level 0 (VMAP0) revision 4 hydrographic layers, except where revision editing has been performed. Key value-added characteristics include river flow direction, connectivity and the tagging of geographical name keys to selected rivers, lakes and islands included in the Concise Gazetteer of Canada.  
  
The Atlas Frameworks are a set of integrated base map layers which form part of a larger National Scale Frameworks data collection. These data have been compiled at a scale of 1:1 000 000 with the primary goal being to indicate correct relative positioning with other framework layers rather than absolute positional accuracy.

data,Raptor - Wildlife Key Area - 250k,"<div style=""text-align:Left;"">

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

data,Wetlands - Broad Scale,"This dataset (WETLAND_BROAD_POLY) is a composite of several individual wetland mapping projects, collectively referred to as ""Wetlands - Broad Scale"". The methodology used, map accuracy, and credits vary by project; these project details are outlined in Table 5 (see below). The spatial extent of individual projects are delineated in a separate feature class entitled, ""WETLAND_BROAD_EXTENTS_POLY"". The ""Project Name"" attribute field, common to both feature classes, denotes the specific project each feature is associated with.  
  
  
  
  
This dataset is intended to be used as a broad scale planning and management tool to identify potential distribution and abundance of wetlands. Wetlands were mapped to wetland class (shallow water, marsh, swamp, fen, and bog), following the Canadian Wetland Classification System using a predictive model. This dataset is intended to support land management and regional land use planning processes. Local scale (10k) manual wetland mapping, and additional physical assessments (i.e. ground inspections) may be required to undertake habitat enhancement, environmental assessment, reclamation planning, or environmental mitigation over small to moderate areas.  
  
  
  
<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">  
  
  
<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">Map development:  
  
The ""Wetlands - Broad Scale"" dataset was developed using a random forest machine learning model to predict wetland classes. Various satellite imagery sources and landscape variables derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used as primary inputs to predict wetlands. The source dataset has a resolution of 10 x 10 m. Training and validation data are a mix of ground plots (site visit and ecosystem plots), aerial survey plots, and interpreted polygons. Each predictive wetland map within the composite has met the minimum criteria of a map accuracy greater than or equal to 70 % and a Kappa coefficient greater than 0.60.  
  
  
  
  
The map (or producer's) accuracy measures the percentage of wetland features that are correctly classified to one of the five wetland classes.  
  
  
  
  
The Kappa coefficient statistic is used to measure the extent to which the model has correctly predicted, given the set of validation data. A value of 0 indicates predicted values are entirely random. A value of 1 indicates a perfect model. As a general rule, Kappa coefficients less than 0.60 indicate a poorly performing model, values of 0.61 to 0.80 indicate substantial agreement between predicted and validation data, and values of 0.81 to 1.00 indicate almost perfect agreement.  
  
  
  
  
The size of the smallest wetland that can be reliably mapped, the Target Mapping Unit (TMU), was not established for this dataset at the time of publication. Wetland classes smaller than a TMU of 2.0 hectares in this dataset should be used with caution. Wetlands below the TMU have a higher potential to be associated with classification error. The reported map accuracy is adequate for the intended purpose, and assumes that training data has adequately captured variation in landscape and vegetation structure between and within wetland classes.

Table 4 describes five wetland classes and one non-wetland class that apply to this dataset. The five wetland classes that are recognized based on broadly similar site conditions along dominant environmental gradients as reflected in physiognomy (the life form, structure, and stature of vegetation) and species with similar adaptations. Non-wetland water systems are also mapped at this level.

Polygons were interpreted from a combination of SPOT-6, Pleiades-1, ESRI World Imagery, and Sentinel-2 imagery. Training polygons reflected the extent and variability of nine land cover classes within the planning area and are in proportion to the aerial extent of land cover class (including wetland classes). Interpreted polygons were used to train the model. The model was validated using point location of aerial field calls and ground plots. The ratio of training to validation data was 3:1. In this dataset, the smallest mapped wetland, or minimum mapping unit (MMU), is 2 pixels or 200 square metres.

data,Shorebird - Wildlife Key Area - 250k,"<div style=""text-align:Left;"">

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

data,Contacts,"Yukon Bedrock Geology MapThis update of the Yukon bedrock geology map builds upon the previous compilation by Gordey and Makepeace (1999, 2001). It includes new, detailed bedrock geology maps and regional compilations that have been published by the Yukon Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada between 1999 and 2015, as well as some recent thesis works. A few of these maps were partially integrated into the digital dataset by Gordey and Makepeace (2003), but only as overlay to the 1999 compilation. A number of errors and omissions from the 1999 compilation of Gordey and Makepeace were also noted and corrected during compilation of this version of the map. The Yukon bedrock geology GIS dataset is regularly updated and can be downloaded from the Yukon Geological Survey's website: www.geology.gov.yk.ca. Users are advised to consult the website regularly to ensure they are working with the latest version of the geodatabase or shape files. This update of the GIS dataset includes an expanded attribute structure (compared to the 1999 dataset) that facilitates searching of the geodatabase. The Yukon Geological Survey aims to provide users with the best available geoscience data for Yukon. Any revisions or additional geological information known to the user would be welcomed by the Yukon Geological Survey.

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

There are 443 GMAs in the Yukon which are grouped together into 11 Zones. In general, Zone boundaries follow highway centre lines and Subzone boundaries follow creeks and rivers. In effect, GMAs delineate mountain blocks, which reflects their original use as sheep management units. Despite this original intent, GMAs are now used to manage all species of Yukon wildlife.

data,Mountain Goat - Wildlife Key Area - 250k,"<div style=""text-align:Left;"">

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

data,Aquatic health monitoring sites,"The Adaptive Management Framework for Yukon placer mining is complemented by traditional knowledge and monitoring of water quality objectives, aquatic health, and economic health. The aquatic health monitoring program is governed by the Aquatic Health Monitoring Protocol. The Protocol describes the locations, timing, frequency and methods employed during sampling, as well as the methods used to analyze sampling data. The Reference Condition Approach (RCA) is the method chosen for assessing the health of freshwater ecosystems in the Yukon. One RCA model was developed for bioassessment based upon benthic macroinvertebrates, and a second model was developed to assess the diversity of fish species. The RCA model for invertebrates relies upon 224 reference sites collected over the period 2004 to 2010 by the University of Western Ontario, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Yukon G overnment, using the same standard protocol. The invertebrate data set was analyzed at the family level. There are two fundamental steps in the process of developing the predictive model. The first is to classify the reference sites based on their biological characteristics. This requires defining a number of community types based on the taxonomic composition. The second step is to determine a subset of habitat attributes that are associated with those community types. Following this step the number and type of organisms expected to occur at any given site can be determined from habitat attributes. For more information, contact the Yukon Placer Secretariat.

The original maps were produced by various agencies, including the Geological Survey of Canada, YGS, Yukon Government, universities, and the City of Whitehorse.  
  
All original feature descriptions have been preserved and also converted to standardized values using the Yukon terrain classification system. The compilation includes 4 GIS datasets and supporting documents available for download via <a href=""https://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/Compilation/33"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">YGS integrated data system</a> (YGSIDS) or GeoYukon. A .lyr file is <a href=""https://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/Compilation/33"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">provided</a> to symbolize feature classes and differentiate overlapping maps at different scales. Additionally, there is a surficial geology map index.  
  
The polygon attributes captured include surficial material, texture, age, surface expression, and geomorphological processes.  
  
Line features include geological contacts, glacial limits, glacial landforms (cirques, arêtes, eskers, meltwater channels, moraines), and non-glacial landforms (faults, lineaments, landslides, escarpments).  
  
Point features include field station, fossil and sample locations, glacial landforms (erratics, kames, kettles, drumlins, flutings), permafrost features (pingos, palsas, patterned ground, thermokarst depressions), and other non-glacial landforms (landslides, tors).  
  
The map index provides information on each map publication such as author, map title, map scale, publisher.  
  
These data are valuable for land-use applications in the territory, including: mineral and placer exploration, geotechnical engineering, infrastructure planning, granular resource assessments, permafrost modeling, agricultural assessments, forest management, and biophysical or ecological land classification.

data,Glacial limits - 1M,"Yukon Territory has been glaciated by Cordilleran and montane glaciers at various times throughout the Pleistocene, as well as by continental ice, the Laurentine Ice Sheet in the Late Pleistocene. Throughout the Late Cenozoic, each successive glaciation appears to have been less extensive than the previous one. In west-central Yukon the earliest glaciation occurred between 2.6 and 2.9 Ma. ago (Duk-Rodkin and Barendregt, 1997). This glaciation was the most extensive and formed a continuous carapace of ice covering all the mountain ranges, except for a small area of Dawson Range and a more extensive area in northern Yukon. The Mid Pleistocene Cordilleran glaciation was less extensive than older glaciations but it formed an extensive ice sheet covering most of the northern Cordillera. The Late Pleistocene glaciation was the most restrictive and formed a continuous carapace of ice from the continental divide to the Saint Elias Mountains, but only restricted ice caps formed on the Ogilvie Mountains. During the last glaciation, the Laurentide Ice Sheet, flowing from the east, reached the northeast part of the Yukon Territory ca. 30 ka ago.

data,CDC Species of Conservation Concern,"This dataset shows the known and previously reported location of rare plants and animals in Yukon Territory as mapped by the Yukon Conservation Data Centre. The Yukon Conservation Data Centre follows NatureServe methodology that depicts Element Occurrences (an area of land and/or water in which a species is or was present)(EO) as polygons. These polygons include locational uncertainty. The locational uncertainty incorporates inaccuracies that can be associated with the collection of location information, such as inaccurate GPSs or vague locational descriptions. Data are mapped at 1:50,000 or larger scale. A user manual describing the data can be found at <a href=""https://mapservices.gov.yk.ca:443/geoyukon/Understanding_Yukon_Conservation_Data_Centre_Data.pdf"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">https://mapservices.gov.yk.ca/geoyukon/Understanding_Yukon_Conservation_Data_Centre_Data.pdf</a> .

It is very important to note that the absence of mapped locations in an area of interest does not necessarily mean that there are no species of conservation concern present; only that there are none currently recorded in the database. A detailed assessment of the site conducted during the appropriate season by qualified biologists is the only way to confirm presence or absence of a species of conservation concern.

data,Curie Point Depth,"Curie point depth (CPD) mapping in Yukon was done using public domain aeromagnetic data from Natural Resources Canada. In this study, two different CPD methodologies were employed using two different window sizes (200 km and 300 km). Qualitatively, the results were broadly consistent regardless of the method or window size. South-central Yukon exhibits shallow CPD values while northern and southeastern Yukon have deeper CPD values. This suggests that south-central Yukon has higher levels of heat flow in the mid-to-lower crust compared to the rest of the territory. The CPD results are largely consistent with heat flow measurements from the near surface. Specifically, regions with shallow CPD estimates correspond to areas with elevated heat flow measurements. Geologically, the regions with shallow CPD correspond to the Cordillera, while deep CPD areas appear to be co-located with continental platform rocks of Ancestral North America. Comparison with Yukon-specific crustal geotherms derived from other data suggest that the CPD estimates for south-central Yukon are systematically too deep by 2 to 12 km. The discrepancy is likely caused by the need to better understand and account for the fractal distribution of magnetization in the crust in Yukon. The results of this CPD study are valuable in that 95% of Yukon has been demarcated into regions of shallow CPD (higher heat flow) and deep CPD (lower heat flow). These findings should be combined with other data, such as heat generation and sediment thickness estimates, to identify the most prospective regions of elevated subsurface heat in Yukon. Contours have been created for the gridded curie point depth at 1 km intervals and are presented along with the grid.

The landscape hazard map identifies existing and potential geological hazards such as landslides, permafrost stability and flooding. The hazard map is presented in stoplight colours to provide an intuitive tool for community decision makers aiming to incorporate an adaptation planning framework into existing land use management practices.

data,Regional Geochemical Surveys - RGS - AAS - 250k,"Regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation  
  
November 2020  
  
Release notes  
  
The regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation comprises data for more than 30 000 samples across Yukon. This compilation updates the work of Héon (2003). This new compilation includes results from the reanalysis of more than 24 000 samples; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis provides upgraded detection limits and a broader range of elements relative to previous analytical data. In addition to analytical data, efforts have been made to improve sample location accuracy. The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:  
  

1.  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.  
      
2.  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in Héon (2003) with minor updates to sample location.  
      
3.  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.  
      
4.  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.  
      
5.  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).  
      
6.  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.  
      

Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below.  
  
For atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using Lefort aqua regia or concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.  
  
For instrumental neutron activation analysis ( INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.  
  
For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment ( the minus 0.177 mm fraction) ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.  
  
Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey. Your feedback contributes to improving the accuracy of the geoscience databases for Yukon.

data,Major Faults,"The framework of the Cordilleran orogen of northwestern North America is commonly depicted as a 'collage' of terranes - crustal blocks containing records of a variety of geodynamic environments including continental fragments, pieces of island arc crust and oceanic crust.  
  
The series of maps available here are derived from a GIS compilation of terranes based on the map first published by Colpron et al. (2007) and more recently revised by Nelson et al. (2013). These maps are presented here in digital formats including ArcGIS file geodatabase (.gdb), shapefiles (.shp and related files), Google Earth (.kmz), as well as graphic files (.pdf). The GIS data includes terrane polygons and selected major Late Cretaceous and Tertiary strike-slip faults. Graphic PDF files derived from the GIS compilation were prepared for the Northern Cordillera (Alaska, Yukon and BC), the Canadian Cordillera (BC and Yukon), Yukon, and British Columbia. These maps are intended for page-size display (~1:5,000,000 and smaller). Polygons are accurate to ~1 km for Yukon and BC, ~5 km for Alaska. More detailed geological data are available from both BCGC, USGS and YGS websites. Descriptions of the terranes, their tectonic evolution and metallogeny can be found in Colpron et al. (2007), Nelson and Colpron (2007), Colpron and Nelson (2009), Nelson et al. (2013) and references therein.

data,Whale - Wildlife Key Area - 250k,"<div style=""text-align:Left;"">

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

This update of the Yukon bedrock geology map builds upon the previous compilation by Gordey and Makepeace (1999, 2001). It includes new, detailed bedrock geology maps and regional compilations that have been published by the Yukon Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada between 1999 and 2015, as well as some recent thesis works. A few of these maps were partially integrated into the digital dataset by Gordey and Makepeace (2003), but only as overlay to the 1999 compilation. A number of errors and omissions from the 1999 compilation of Gordey and Makepeace were also noted and corrected during compilation of this version of the map.

Users are advised to consult the website regularly to ensure they are working with the latest version of the geodatabase or shape files. This update of the GIS dataset includes an expanded attribute structure (compared to the 1999 dataset) that facilitates searching of the geodatabase.

data,Community Hazards - Pelly Crossing - 20k,"Landscape hazard maps were completed as part of a community hazards mapping program coordinated by the Northern Climate ExChange (Yukon Research Centre, Yukon College). Potential landscape hazards were assessed under changing future conditions by incorporating a variety of data sets, including surficial geology, topography (slope and aspect), permafrost distribution, site-specific permafrost data (e.g. ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography and borehole data), analyses of past hydrological and climatological trends, and future climate projections. The landscape hazard map identifies existing and potential geological hazards such as landslides, permafrost stability and flooding. The hazard map is presented in stoplight colours to provide an intuitive tool for community decision makers aiming to incorporate an adaptation planning framework into existing land use management practices.

November 2020  
  
Release notes  
  
The regional stream sediment geochemical data compilation comprises data for more than 30 000 samples across Yukon. This compilation updates the work of Héon (2003). This new compilation includes results from the reanalysis of more than 24 000 samples; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis provides upgraded detection limits and a broader range of elements relative to previous analytical data. In addition to analytical data, efforts have been made to improve sample location accuracy. The data in this release are organized by analytical method with the geodatabase having six feature classes:  
  

1.  RGS_SITE_WATER - site specific physiography and water quality data. These data are unchanged from the original releases.  
      
2.  RGS_HEON - the same data as released in Héon (2003) with minor updates to sample location.  
      
3.  RGS_AAS - all samples analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Most of these data are superseded by INAA and ICPMS data.  
      
4.  RGS_INAA - all samples analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis.  
      
5.  RGS_ICPMS - all samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).  
      
6.  RGS_All - includes all AAS, INAA and ICPMS data.  
      

Collection of stream sediment samples in Yukon began in 1976 and ended in 2006. Three analytical methods have been used to analyze the minus 0.177 mm fraction (-80 mesh) of these samples: AAS, INNA (and FA-NA) and ICPMS. A simple description of each method is given below.  
  
For atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) a 1 g aliquot is 'partially digested' using Lefort aqua regia or concentrated hot nitric acid. The digestion product is analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxide and silicate minerals are partially digested while some sulphide minerals are erratically volatilized. This means that AAS cannot be used to obtain accurate REE, Ta, Nb, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, Cr, or Au determinations.  
  
For instrumental neutron activation analysis ( INAA), aliquots of sieved sediment (the minus 0.177 mm fraction) or milled rock ranging from 5 to 40 g are encapsulated and irradiated in a nuclear reactor before counting the primary gamma radiation induced by the neutron irradiation with a high resolution germanium gamma ray detector. Fire assay-neutron activation (FA-NA) analysis is similar but includes a pre-concentration fire assay step prior to irradiation and analysis. Results for both INAA and FA-NA are similar to those for samples analyses by fusion or other total digestion techniques. Neutron activation detection limits are typically higher than those by acid digestion - ICPMS. Commodity and pathfinder elements such as Au, As, Sb and W have reasonable detection limits by INAA and the data generated are relatively precise.  
  
For ICPMS analysis, aliquots of sieved sediment ( the minus 0.177 mm fraction) ranging from 0.5 to 1 g are prepared using a partial digestion technique, typically aqua regia, followed by analysis of dissolution product by ICPMS. Sulphide minerals are completely oxidized and dissolved whereas most oxide and silicate minerals are only partially digested. This means that results produced by partial digestion methods are acceptable for elements such as Ag, As, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn but values for elements such as Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, P, Sn, Ti, Y, and Zr are likely to not reflect the actual element concentration in a sample. The sample size used for routine RGS sample analysis is too small be representative of Au in the original sample and thus Au by aqua regia digestion - ICPMS has poor precision.  
  
Further upgrades to this database are not anticipated. All samples that could be found in the GSC-Ottawa warehouse have been reanalyzed using ICPMS. Any errors or omissions in this database should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey. Your feedback contributes to improving the accuracy of the geoscience databases for Yukon.

data,Outfitting Concessions - 250k,"Outfitting Concessions (OCs) which are also known as Outfitting Areas, are legal boundaries that define an area where the holder of the concession has the exclusive right to outfit non-residents for the purpose of hunting big game animals (excepting special guiding licenses). If a non-resident wishes to hunt in the Yukon they must do so accompanied by a Yukon resident--either a private individual who does this for free, or a commercial operator who does this as a business(an outfitter). Each outfitter is licensed to operate within a particular OA. There are 20 such concessions in the Yukon--one per licensed outfitter. OCs are largely (but not always) defined by groupings of Game Management Areas. There are several areas within the Yukon (exclusive of National Parks) which are not covered by OCs. This data was built using the 1:250,000 National Topographic Data Base (NTDB) as the digitizing base.

data,Curie Point Depth Contours,"Curie point depth (CPD) mapping in Yukon was done using public domain aeromagnetic data from Natural Resources Canada. In this study, two different CPD methodologies were employed using two different window sizes (200 km and 300 km). Qualitatively, the results were broadly consistent regardless of the method or window size. South-central Yukon exhibits shallow CPD values while northern and southeastern Yukon have deeper CPD values. This suggests that south-central Yukon has higher levels of heat flow in the mid-to-lower crust compared to the rest of the territory. The CPD results are largely consistent with heat flow measurements from the near surface. Specifically, regions with shallow CPD estimates correspond to areas with elevated heat flow measurements. Geologically, the regions with shallow CPD correspond to the Cordillera, while deep CPD areas appear to be co-located with continental platform rocks of Ancestral North America. Comparison with Yukon-specific crustal geotherms derived from other data suggest that the CPD estimates for south-central Yukon are systematically too deep by 2 to 12 km. The discrepancy is likely caused by the need to better understand and account for the fractal distribution of magnetization in the crust in Yukon. The results of this CPD study are valuable in that 95% of Yukon has been demarcated into regions of shallow CPD (higher heat flow) and deep CPD (lower heat flow). These findings should be combined with other data, such as heat generation and sediment thickness estimates, to identify the most prospective regions of elevated subsurface heat in Yukon. Contours have been created for the gridded curie point depth at 1 km intervals and are presented along with the grid.

data,Trapping Concessions - 250k,"Registered Trapping Concessions (RTCs) are legal boundaries that define an area where the holder of the concession has the exclusive right to trap furbearing animals. Because trapping is done primarily along waterways, RTCs are often defined by watersheds, using height of land (ridges and mountain peaks) as their boundaries. This is the opposite of GMAs which are defined by mountains. Sometimes RTCs are grouped together to form a Group Trapping Concession (in which groups of individual share the right to trap). This may or may not involve the elimination of the component RTC boundaries. The Yukon has 360 RTCs and 13 Group Trapping Concessions. Only Kluane National Park, Kluane Wildlife Sanctuary, and Ddhaw Ghro Habitat Protection are are not covered by RTCs. This data was built using the 1:250,000 National Topographic Data Base (NTDB) as the digitizing base.

data,Wetlands - Broad Scale - Project Extents,"The ""WETLAND_BROAD_POLY"" dataset is a composite of several individual wetland mapping projects, collectively referred to as ""Wetlands - Broad Scale"". The methodology used, map accuracy, and credits vary by project; these project details are outlined in Table 1 (see below). The spatial extent of individual project areas are delineated in this feature class.  
  
  
  
  
The ""Wetlands - Broad Scale"" dataset is intended to be used as a broad scale planning and management tool to identify potential distribution and abundance of wetlands. Wetlands were mapped to wetland class (shallow water, marsh, swamp, fen, and bog), following the Canadian Wetland Classification System using a predictive model. This dataset is intended to support land management and regional land use planning processes. Local scale (10k) manual wetland mapping, and additional physical assessments (i.e. ground inspections) may be required to undertake habitat enhancement, environmental assessment, reclamation planning, or environmental mitigation over small to moderate areas.  
  
  
  
<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">  
  
  
<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">Map development and attributes:  
  
The ""Wetlands - Broad Scale"" dataset was developed using a random forest machine learning model to predict wetland classes. Various satellite imagery sources and landscape variables derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used as primary inputs to predict wetlands. The source dataset has a resolution of 10 x 10 m. Training and validation data are a mix of ground plots (site visit and ecosystem plots), aerial survey plots, and interpreted polygons. Each predictive wetland map within the composite has met the minimum criteria of a map accuracy greater than or equal to 70 % and a Kappa coefficient greater than 0.60.  
  
  
  
  
The map (or producer's) accuracy measures the percentage of wetland features that are correctly classified to one of the five wetland classes.  
  
  
  
  
The Kappa coefficient statistic is used to measure the extent to which the model has correctly predicted, given the set of validation data. A value of 0 indicates predicted values are entirely random. A value of 1 indicates a perfect model. As a general rule, Kappa coefficients less than 0.60 indicate a poorly performing model, values of 0.61 to 0.80 indicate substantial agreement between predicted and validation data, and values of 0.81 to 1.00 indicate almost perfect agreement.  
  
  
  
  
The size of the smallest wetland that can be reliably mapped, the Target Mapping Unit (TMU), was not established for this dataset at the time of publication. Wetland classes smaller than a TMU of 2.0 hectares in this dataset should be used with caution. Wetlands below the TMU have a higher potential to be associated with classification error. The reported map accuracy is adequate for the intended purpose, and assumes that training data has adequately captured variation in landscape and vegetation structure between and within wetland classes.

Training and validation data was comprised of 250 ground plots (site visit and ecosystem plots), 264 aerial survey plots, and 1,621 interpreted polygons. Polygons were interpreted from a combination of SPOT-6, Pleiades-1, ESRI World Imagery, and Sentinel-2 imagery. Training polygons reflected the extent and variability of nine land cover classes within the planning area and are in proportion to the aerial extent of land cover class (including wetland classes). Interpreted polygons were used to train the model. The model was validated using point location of aerial field calls and ground plots. The ratio of training to validation data was 3:1. In this dataset, the smallest mapped wetland, or minimum mapping unit (MMU), is 2 pixels or 200 square metres. The pixel resolution of the wetland map is 10 m, however all single pixels were merged into to their neighbouring pixel value.<br />

data,Assessment Report Geochemistry,"The Yukon Geological Survey stores a significant amount of geological information gathered by exploration companies in compliance with the Quartz Mining Act. This information is primarily contained in assessment reports (AR). Since 1920, more than 8000 hardrock assessment reports have been collected, with more than 6000 of these containing geochemical data on surficial samples (e.g., soil, rock, stream sediment, and vegetation). The sheer volume and historical depth of these data provide valuable insight into the mineral potential of the Yukon. Exploration companies rely on data from ARs to search for exploration targets. To aid exploration companies, YGS has developed this database to consolidate geochemical data extracted from assessment reports. This database, the Geochemical Assessment Report Data Extracted database (GARDEd), was created by extracting and compiling data from more than 300 assessment reports. GARDEd was initially populated with data from samples within a 75 km radius of the Casino deposit to evaluate the data extraction procedures and assess the feasibility of the database. Data capture focused on recent ARs because these were available in digital format. The initial release of this database contains approximately 10% of the geochemical data from surface samples within Yukon ARs.  
  
YGS encourages users to send feedback to <a href=""mailto:%20geology@yukon.ca:25"" style=""text-decoration:underline;"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">geology@yukon.ca</a> to assess the usefulness of the dataset and determine how much effort should be invested to capture older, non-digital ARs.

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically. For the most current information, please consult with the Regional Biologist for your area of interest. If you have questions or would like to contribute to the WKA database, please contact the WKA Inventory Program ( [<u>wka@yukon.ca</u>](mailto:wka@yukon.ca:25) ).

The original maps were produced by various agencies, including the Geological Survey of Canada, YGS, Yukon Government, universities, and the City of Whitehorse.  
  
All original feature descriptions have been preserved and also converted to standardized values using the Yukon terrain classification system.

Additionally, there is a surficial geology map index.  
  
The polygon attributes captured include surficial material, texture, age, surface expression, and geomorphological processes.  
  
Line features include geological contacts, glacial limits, glacial landforms (cirques, arêtes, eskers, meltwater channels, moraines), and non-glacial landforms (faults, lineaments, landslides, escarpments).  
  
Point features include field station, fossil and sample locations, glacial landforms (erratics, kames, kettles, drumlins, flutings), permafrost features (pingos, palsas, patterned ground, thermokarst depressions), and other non-glacial landforms (landslides, tors).  
  
The map index provides information on each map publication such as author, map title, map scale, publisher.  
  
These data are valuable for land-use applications in the territory, including: mineral and placer exploration, geotechnical engineering, infrastructure planning, granular resource assessments, permafrost modeling, agricultural assessments, forest management, and biophysical or ecological land classification.

Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically.

data,Yukon Whole Rock Pb-Nd-Hf-Sr and Feldspar Pb Isotope Compilation,"This compilation includes published Nd, Hf, Sr and Pb (plus minor O, S and C) isotopic data from 1722 whole-rock powders and feldspar separates. About 1200 of these samples are located in Yukon and the remainder are located in British Columbia, Alaska or Northwest Territories. This compilation of whole-rock and feldspar isotopic data builds off of a compilation that Kristen Rasmussen (2013) did as part of her doctoral thesis at the University of British Columbia.  
  
To allow easier integration into a user's GIS platform, and for greater spatial querying of the data, the ""database"" is presented as a ""flat file"" (i.e., shapefile, geodatabase and text formats).  
  
This whole-rock and feldspar isotope database will be subject to periodic updates as new data are acquired through ongoing mapping, exploration and other research activities. Any errors, omissions or new data known to users should be reported to the Yukon Geological Survey. Your feedback contributes to improving the accuracy of the geoscience databases for Yukon.

data,Civic Address Point,"The Yukon civic address point data layer was created by Geomatics Yukon at the Yukon government on behalf of all Yukon address authorities as part of the Civic Address data management and integration project. The civic address data layer was modelled to meet the Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG 9-1-1) data standards for site structure address points based on the Canadian GIS data model version 2.  
  
This Civic address layer is incomplete but is based on the best available data that the Yukon government contains. The original source of the data was from the polygon-based parcel address layer that was linked with legal survey parcels. This point address layer is being regularly updated as more information is provided and confirmed with the project team. Updates are expected to be loaded monthly or bimonthly.  
  
The project team is working with Yukon address authorities to compile civic addresses for all Yukon government site structures. Address authorities are the governments, municipalities, communities, and First Nations governments that are responsible for determining addresses on their land. The project team has reached out to these address authorities as part of the project to offer support to include their civic addresses into one consolidated authoritative Yukon civic address point layer that will meet these NG 9-1-1 standards. The communities and First Nations addresses will be added as they are ready and able to provide them to the project team, based on the project team's available resources. The target will be to have a complete civic address database by the end of 2024.  
  
A long term program will need to be established for maintenance of this data beyond the life of the project.

Wildlife Key Areas (WKA) are locations used by wildlife for critical, seasonal life functions. WKAs are identified by interpreting observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not through intensive habitat assessment. Polygons derived from interviews with locals and from GIS interpretation of wildlife/habitat surveys. GIS interpretation follows criteria specific for taxon and/or populations of taxon. Key Areas are based on observed locations of wildlife at key times of year, not on habitat assessment. With new information, boundaries and designations of Key Areas can change and additional Key Areas can be identified. Furthermore, Key Areas are not the only sites important for wildlife. Other information sources can identify other sites important for wildlife for reasons outside the scope of the WKA Inventory Program. Updates to Key Areas occur only periodically.

data,Geotechnical borehole point,"Geotechnical data comes from investigations performed by geotechnical engineers to obtain information on the physical properties of soil and rock underlying a site for proposed structures. The investigations include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. In addition, site investigations will often include subsurface sampling and laboratory testing of the soil samples retrieved. The digging of test pits and trenching may also be used to learn about soil conditions at depth. Geotechnical data is relevant to our permafrost database as it contains logs of ice encountered at various depths.

The landscape hazard map identifies existing and potential geological hazards such as landslides, permafrost stability and flooding. The hazard map is presented in stoplight colours to provide an intuitive tool for community decision makers aiming to incorporate an adaptation planning framework into existing land use management practices.

data,Fire history,"This is a landscape level GIS coverage of large fires within the Yukon, spanning a period from 1946 to present. Original polygon size was limited to 200 hectares, when the first edition of this dataset was completed in 1997. Smaller fires are now being included, especially near communities. It is important to note that in most instances, fire perimeters only were mapped. This means that unburned areas within the perimeter are not accounted for, either in an ecological context or in annual area burned summaries. More recent fires mapped, with the aid of satellite technology may include large unburned patches.Although the temporal scale of the coverage goes back to late 1940's, Yukon-wide fire detection capability was not fully developed until the 1960's. In addition to this, access to regular aerial mapping was not readily available until that same time period. As a result many fires in the 40's and 50's were simply not recorded or poorly mapped, particularly in the north. For that reason, care must be taken when drawing conclusions from these data as it relates to the early years.
